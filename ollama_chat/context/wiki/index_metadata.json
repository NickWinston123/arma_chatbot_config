We play together in fortress competitions and we have a space at forums.armagetronad.net (we also have a little indipendent site ) where we talk about armagetron or anything else we like to talk. About competitions, we would like to invite some external players to join us for the occasions, of course without obbligations. We think that playing together and share experiences is the best way to have great times playing this game, so don't be afraid to ask if you would like to play with us!

The name, the tag, and the players has been found rapidly and the µ|micro team had all of a perfect team. We joined them, but what did happen?! It didn't work, the players were too detached and me and Hay-Lin decided to play respectively for WS and AW. After the Ladle we had an idea: \"why don't we build our own clan?!\". First we looked for a name and a tag. Hay-Lin thought about ¢¢ = ¢yber ¢ombat clan but we finally chose °° = OOps clan.

Only if absolutely necessary to stop excessive flaming should anybody need to silence anyone, anytime. It is expected that people may \"trash talk\" some, and tease each other as part of the fun! Excessive moderation can cause more trouble than good. 2. If a player is truly being unruly, the first step is to talk to them. The second step, is to silence them. The third step is to suspend them. The fourth step is to kick them. The assumption is that if things hit step four, they are kicked not just from the server, but from the tournament. 3. If there is a dispute about the results of a match, a Global Moderator will contact me immediately, and I will either review the log myself, or give them the info to look. However, Global Moderators will be expected to just use their best judgment to sort out any mess that happens. Compguygene is a very busy family"

This should be the central place for anyone to meet if they don't know where to go or what to do. Ideally teams should just show up in the server that they play in without needing to meet anywhere and start the first round within 5 minutes of the start time! Any team that is not ready to play by 5 minutes of the scheduled start time, will be considered to forfeit or play with whoever is there. Time delays to start the tournament will NOT be tolerated.

Each team has 4 players. In the past we tried teams of 5, but the excess lag made this team size impractical. 4-Team Fort is generally a spontaneous event often decided mere days before it happens. Players should show the same sportsmanship as Ladle. However, there are no guidelines regarding team sign ups and placement on the bracket. 4TF runs successfully as a \"Spoon style\" event. That means, teams sign up on the Challenge Board then place themselves on the opening round brackets wherever they choose (without editing another team of course!). Event organizers must do their best to accommodate the teams. This may involve adjusting a second or third server to handle an odd number of teams and/or adjusting the"

Any fresh ideas about how it went and so on... from ghableska I agree with 2020, it was IMHO a lot easier, and relaxed. The games seemed to move a lot slower than our matches against the Somethingsomething. I had some keyboard troubles and had to quit in the middle of the game and restart. And we believe (hopefully) that a fake Lucifer came in. And we kicked him. Other than that, it was quite normal. from Van Ya it was a more relaxed game, first match wasnt too hard but second one had me worried when they took the lead. Without 8vs8 we had to constantly kick people though, which is annoying but really doesnt effect much. O ya and that was a fake luci, it was really pimp. from PsYkO Omg by the end of that 2nd match my fingers were so mangled..I think the key to winning these things is to STAY ALIVE.

Tron was an arcade game based on the movie of the same name, release by Disney in 1982. The original game consisted of 4 sub-games, the only one of concern is the 'Light Cycles' one, in which the player uses a left/right joystick to control a 'Light Cycle' which leaves a wall behind it wherever the cycle it goes, turning only at 90 degree angles. The player must then get the AI to crash into their wall while avoiding hitting the AI's own wall themselves. Those were the humble beginnings of Armagetron Advanced's game play, which has now blossomed into 16 player mayhem, with highly advanced AI, network game play, and of course all in a 3D environment. The History Armagetron Advanced is the continuation of Manual Moos', alias, z-man's original game, Armagetron. The project was officially registered June 2, 2004, but had it's founding a month or two earlier"

While it was never really successful, the fact that builds could be made for Windows, and the presence of qualified C++ programmers, spurred us onwards to creating the SourceForge project, and releasing 0.2.7.0. When almost all hope of ever seeing z-man again was lost, he miraculously returned to the Armagetron scene, and has been with us since. We're now the official continuation of Armagetron, and things are rolling smoothly. The Now Development continues, of course! 0.2.8 is en-route, every day bigger and better features are being discussed and of course bugs are being fixed. Remember the infamous wall bug? Gone now! The Future The upcoming release, 0.2.8.0, contains multiple bug fixes, restoring gameplay to as it was originally intended. But, it also contains enhancements multiplying the possibilities. Why play in a box? Play in a cross, an octagon or even in a hexagon flower. Don't just turn at 90 degrees, turn at 60, 120, or any other angle you can imagine.

Generally, these connections are directly connected to an ISP's network, which is then uplinked to the larger internet as a whole. As a result, there are a number of hops and latency just to get out to the internet. The same applies in the reverse. This means that if both the player and the server are on a residental connection, you might have 5 or more hops to get out to the internet, some variable number of hops actually on the mainstream internet, and then another 5 or more hops to reach the server. Overall, that means your gameplay can cross as many or even more than 16 hops, each one adding more lag! The only solution to this is to locate your server on a business-class connection with a direct path to the internet. Obviously the hops on the player's side will still be there, but this can cut out extra hops on the server end. Often times this will be very expensive-- if you wanted to keep the server at home, it"

Bandwidth Limiting Bandwidth is measured in kilobytes per second and is controlled by MAX_OUT_RATE. If you set it to 4, there will be some lag at the beginning of the round. 6 is considered minimum for a production server. To calculate how many players to limit on your server, you need to know how much upstream bandwidth you have. That's bandwidth leaving your server. :) Then figure out how much of that you want your game server to use. Divide it by 6. If you get a really large number, such as 3000, then you probably don't need to worry about limiting bandwidth. On the other hand, if you come out near 20, then try a higher number. Keep trying until you get to the highest number for the number of players. You can test your internet speed by visiting one of the websites in the resource section at"

Since you can't have 2/3 of a player, that's 10 players. That's also using the recommended minimum setting. Let's assume you want to have a maximum of 12 players on your server. Divide 64 by 12 and you get: 5.33333kb/sec. So you can go ahead and do MAX_OUT_RATE 5.3333333 and MAX_CLIENTS 12 and your full server will need all available upstream bandwidth. Now, you say you want to be able to surf the web and send email while people are playing on your server? Easy enough. Leave some room. So you decide that 32kb/sec is enough for you to do your other internet tasks without significantly disturbing the players on your server. 64-32=32kb/sec available for the server. 32/12=2.66666666, so you won't be able to handle 12 clients and leave that much room for other uses.

The rest of the time, it just eats chips or something. You limit the framerate of the simulation with DEDICATED_FPS . You'll have to decide what you prefer for the simulation, but you can use this setting to get more mileage out of your server. Good values range from 50-100. You should aim for a certain CPU usage target. So for example, you decide that 10% usage is the most the server should take up, then you connect MAX_CLIENTS number of clients to the server, open up a process viewer that shows CPU load for the server process, and play with DEDICATE_FPS until the process uses about 10%, which is your target in this example. There's no hard and fast rule, and CPU usage will vary depending on how much it has to simulate, so pick a DEDICATED_FPS that makes for the most stable game you like to play.

We'll touch on each of them here. Moderation A common way is to have a group of moderators available so that your server usually has people logged in and playing who can use in-game admin to kick evil doers out of the server. You do this by setting ADMIN_PASS in your settings_custom.cfg file and then giving that password out to your preferred moderators. Then they will use the password like this: While playing on the server, in a chat prompt, type /login ADMIN_PASS , replacing ADMIN_PASS with the password you have set for the server. This logs the player into the in-game admin system. Now you can execute commands with /admin COMMAND ARGUMENTS . Use /logout to leave the in-game admin system. Every command is available, so be cautious to whom you give your ADMIN_PASS ! ADMIN_PASS might no longer work Attention:"

There are some more safeguards in 0.2.8 to deal with this, but if you still use 0.2.7 it is an issue you may need to face. To enable voting, you should copy the group of settings from settings_dedicated.cfg into your server_info.cfg. The reason it goes in server_info.cfg is because these settings are considered \"policy\" and are not something you'd necessarily share with someone who asked. You might still share them, don't get me wrong, but if someone wants to clone your server and you want to help them, you'd normally just send them settings_custom.cfg and let them come up with their own server policies. The results of votes are decided as early as possible, so if the voters who haven't voted yet (but could still vote) aren't able to change the result the vote already ends.

In order to use a firewall to deal with unruly players, you'll need one that supports some sort of IP-based filtering, such as iptables in Linux. In that case, banning a player is a matter of figuring out their IP address and adding it to your firewall. The most basic way of banning an evil doer is to just drop UDP packets from their IP address that are going to port 4534 (or whatever port your server runs on).

Although these skills can be described, what counts in the number of hours you put in perfecting them. Enjoy. Contents 1 Feinting 2 The Battle of the Grinds 3 The Lag Kill 4 The Dance of Time Feinting In combat terms and in sports, a feint is a fake attack. It is a movement of misdirection that, when executed well, causes the other player to commit themself to a defense. If you know what their defense will be, you can follow the feint with a real attack that attacks their weak point. If that babbling doesn't make any sense, don't worry. Feinting is a critical skill and we'll spend some time with it. Let's look at the speed kill described at The Basics page. The normal way this is executed is by grinding the target's wall for a long time. As you approach the target cycle, you will turn out from his wall, then three times in the opposite direction, then one more time to bring you grinding against the other side of his wall.

At this point the other cycle is forced to make a defensive move of some sort and you know in advance that he will do that, because if he doesn't defend against your feinted attack, you will kill him. The normal defense against a speed attack is to turn in the direction of the attacker, interposing a wall. If done late enough, the attacker can be tricked into crashing into this wall. So knowing that the defender will make this defensive move, you can turn slightly earlier and then make your rapid second turn in the box. At this point, you know that the defender will attempt to defend against the box attack. Another turn away from the attacker is all it takes to finish the deed. TODO: get a picture of this too. The best feints are feints where the defender must take the attack seriously not because he believes it to be an attack, but because he has no choice.

A good feint will be followed through by an unpredictable attack, but making unpredictable attacks requires a certain amount of experience. If the speed feint didn't make sense to you, consider this one, based loosely on a basketball move. In basketball, it's common for the person who has control of the ball to turn towards one teammate and start a passing move. This usually brings the defender around to try to prevent the pass. Many players will then pass the ball in the opposite direction to a different player. Consider the fake involved there. Now apply it to a light cycle. You are approaching more or less head on to another cycle. If you turn right or left, he'll follow you. If you go straight, he'll turn a wall into your path. What do you do? You fake him. You turn left, then quickly turn right twice. This brings you in the opposite direction that he's expecting.

Very often you will find yourself traveling parallel to an enemy cycle at a distance where neither of you can mount a successful attack. Neither of you can advance, either, and if you turn around, you will be pursued, possibly at the pursuer's advantage. So you both drive straight, waiting for the other to make a move.

While there are definitely counter-moves to deal with the player who turns towards you and attacks, there are other ways to deal with this. One way is to turn in towards the other player. This doesn't make sense if you can't possibly grind closer to the wall than he can, does it? Well, it does. The trick is to turn again and get on his wall and grind away. While you usually won't kill the other player, the stalemate will be broken because when the two of you reach the ends of your walls, you will be going faster than he, and that speed conveys a considerable advantage. Turning towards the other player also shows him that you're not scared to fight him. While it may not"

The next time they come against you, they will be inclined to try to grind as close to the wall as possible, and that is their mistake. It is more common to lose the Battle of the Grinds by overextending your grind and dying against the wall than it is to lose it by not grinding close enough. The Lag Kill The Lag Kill has an interesting requirement that most other tactics don't have: humility. If you have a need for the other player to always know and concede that you have killed him, then the Lag Kill isn't for you. In order to use the Lag Kill, you need to be able to deal with the other players blaming lag for the kill. Many players already blame lag when they die more often than it's true, but once you start using lag as a weapon, they'll be half right, and they will frequently completely miss the facts of the matter. The mechanism that enables the Lag Kill is network latency. Look at your ping and look at the ping of your"

That means that the other player will not see the results of your turn for almost a third of a second. That's a long time! It also means that you won't see the results of his turn for the same time period, but every good attack has a danger you need to account for, and for this one, lag is it. So consider the time it takes for the other player to see your moves and what he sees in the meantime , which is usually your cycle going straight. With a little misdirection, you can convince him you are somewhere else completely and essentially attack him from a blind spot. The most basic form of this type of attack is as a defense. Picture yourself driving in a straight line. Now someone gets on your wall and starts grinding it on the left side, obviously aiming for a speed kill. You know that before the critical 1/3-second interval he's going to turn off to box you in, so before that interval you turn left. The other player now thinks you're turning left to"

What he doesn't know is that the 1/3-second interval started right after your turn, and you've turned right again, putting you back in your original direction. As he goes in to finish his box, he doesn't find you trapped in it, he finds your wall instead, and it's entirely possible the server will kill him before he even sees your wall! Another common form of this attack is when you are going nearly head-on towards another player. Before the cycles are within the 1/3-second interval, you turn right. Then the interval starts and you immediately turn left twice, leaving a short dead-end hallway. Many players will follow you after your first right turn and get stuck in the hallway, and again find themselves killed by the server before they even see the hallway. The disadvantage to this tactic is that you get used to it, and eventually you will come up against someone who's ping is so low they can see your hidden moves and deal with it, and lag attacks don't work on those people.

After the discussion is exhausted, an Affray enthusiast makes an Affray Voting Thread with a ballot linked to the discussion. Here is an ideal thread to use as a model. Only teams signed up on the current Challenge Board can vote, one vote per team (usually by a Team Leader or designated representative). The voting ends when the Challenge Board is closed to sign ups (see above). We use a simple majority system: the highest number of votes wins. In case of a tie, no changes are made. Sometimes results may be decided by calculating the mean of the votes, usually when the choices are not binary. This should be"

Things to know Players & Teams The most important things for players and teams to know and do is - Elect a Team Leader who you can trust, who listens to everyone in the team, who is capable of communicating with other Team Leaders, and can follow the procedure to the letter on Affray day. If you have doubts about the reliability of the Team Leader, then you should select an additional Team Leader for your team.

Lag and our lack of tolerance for whining I can't think of a good reason to put up with whining about lag, but we have to admit that other tournaments have the information that supports concluding ping has a role in a game. We have two solutions in place to deal with ping. One is the previously mentioned 10 person limit on the roster. It is hoped that teams will recruit across the pond so that they will generally field a mixed team, and that both teams in any game will be comparable to one another in average pings. However, that is a factor beyond our control. So we created the second mechanism for dealing with lag, which is simply to alternate between servers favorable for each team. So each team plays each other twice, and they're guaranteed one server that is favorable to them (provided they chose such a server). The situation gets a little muddied in the playoffs, but for"

    "text": "the most part, these two mechanisms should reduce the role that ping plays in any given game. On the subject of whining, we will have a winzone. Nobody is required to take it, but folks who have participated in other tournaments have said time and time again that the defender has a huge advantage. The winzone exists to eliminate that advantage in the situation where it actually matters. The only other acceptable alternative is a death zone that kills everyone after some set amount of time. So take the winzone, and take the win. Sportsmanlike behavior Making a call on sportsmanlike behavior is always going to be subjective. You need to try to consider the players that are there. It may be perfectly reasonable for one player to say to another \"You suck\", and for two completely different players to be penalized for it. Determining when a player is behaving badly will always be subjective, especially since a certain amount of trash-talking is inevitable, expected, and fun. The rule of thumb is that bad sportsmanship penalties should be given to the team, not individual players. Teams are expected to behave as a team and to deal with their own problems."

    "text": "Teams that have given a captain (which is most teams) have also reserved to themselves the power to drop a player from their team. In some special circumstances, the player might feel he was wronged and wish to seek some sort of retribution. Rarely will we give it, but depending on circumstances, we might be inclined to help that player find a different team so he can keep playing in the league. Teams that haven't declared a leader are going to have a hard time dropping players, and we might need to get more involved in the decision. Servers Sanctioning a server is like dropping a nuclear bomb on the teams that have declared it as their home server. This is one decision we don't want to make if we don't have to. However, since teams have declared home servers, and many of them control their home servers, there will be a temptation to change server settings to favor the home team. Some of these changes are expected and can't be dealt with due to the nature of an internet game, some of these changes are completely unacceptable. In the case of server-side settings that clients don't even know about,"

    "text": "it can even be impossible to determine if any cheating is happening. The rule is to generally try not to sanction a server, but as soon as it becomes known that a server has been cheating, the team owning it comes under some pretty severe problems. Does the team get to continue playing in the league? If so, do they get to keep their home server? (Usually a team found cheating should be sent to Lucifer's Lag Server as their new home, with all previous games changed to forfeits) Do they get to keep their current game record? Do they get to keep their current lineup? Luckily, most of the server admins this time around are known by the league to be pretty trustworthy, so problems in this area aren't anticipated. Conclusion In conclusion, try to keep in mind that the league exists for people to have fun, and the rules are there to lay down a foundation upon which the most people will have fun playing in the league. Sometimes it'll be necessary to interpret the rules creatively to keep the fun going, sometimes the rules will need to be interpreted rigidly to keep the fun going. But if"

You only get the pass if you showed up on time in good faith for the first game, and the first game legitimately ran late. Games will be scheduled on Wednesdays and Sundays, in GMT.

This is a project full of abnormal modes which means that everything in this mode are originals created by crazy players (like LOVER$BOY). At first, I was developing the mode during my time in the \"Tronners Clan\" but after leaving, I was free to expand. Soon, I had more than 5 modes and very quickly they expanded to over 12 modes. The modes I currently have are: Sonic Fortress World (SFW) Solar Galaxy Racing (SGR) Close Combat Shootout (CCS) Kill Or Be Killed (K.K) Mazed Capture The Flag (MCF) Shooting War Field (SWF) Invisible Capture the Flag (ICF) Reverse Order High Rubber (ROHR) Zombie Shock Land (ZSL) Storming Fast Track (SFT) Kill The King (KTK) Last One Standing (LOS) Titanium Shootout (TSO) Fortified Capture The Flag (FCF) Flagged Racing (FGR) Experimental World (EXP) These modes are originally made by me.

While this is fine for a tournament, it is fundamentally different than league play. League play adds a new dimension to the competition. It requires you to be at your best as often as you play, to watch the schedule and practice with your team. One week your team might decide it needs to work on its best defense because it's playing the top-ranked team. The next week you might switch out your goalie so your regular goalie can go push a grudge against someone on the other team. There's drama, excitement, love, loyalty, honor, and all the other stuff that makes an epic. That epic has finally come to Armagetron, and some would say it is overdue for its arrival. Summer Competition This summer, in the month of July, we intend to run an abbreviated season. It will run for the 4 weeks of July, with a miniature playoff going down in August sometime.

The fall season will require an entry fee which will go to pay any expenses incurred by the functioning of the league. The fall season will be a complete season, where every team plays every other team twice. It will be a round robin tournament, essentially, where the regular season is the seed round for the knock-out portion of the tournament. We are planning for the playoffs to consist of the top 8 teams from the regular season, and we hope to expand to 16 teams asap, but we'll probably never exceed 16 teams in the playoffs.

We hope to use the money to first provide trophies of some sort (t-shirts are planned currently) for winners of various awards, secondly provide quality servers for the competition, and thirdly to compensate league organizers for their time spent organizing and maintaining the league. Fourthly, if some large corporate sponsorship were to occur, as with other leagues, profits would be shared with the teams themselves as well as server administrators who have volunteered their servers for the competition. Teams are free to seek their own sponsorships, of course. The entry fee will be for the whole team, not for each player. So a team that only manages to put 6 people on their roster will pony up the same fee that a 10-person team pays. I'm sorry for the disparity here, we'll try to keep the actual fee as low as possible, just remember that we want to build a long-lasting league, and I'm not convinced it can be done without some money coming in to finance the league."

Advantage: It's so simple we should be able to supply it as a patch to 0.2.8. What's Already There Complete support for password verification is already built in into every client, and with the configure option --enable-krawall, server code that triggers it is activated on the server. What is missing is a function that actually retrieves the right password for a player. The test balloon would reuse it to minimize work to be done and to allow existing clients to participate. Authentication there is handled like this: The client connects to the server as usual, sending the player's data, among that the player name.

In short: One can configure the 0.3.x (perhaps even 0.2.8.x) server in a way, so that users can use their forum's user name and password for authenticating on your server. To aquire this, create a file /etc/armagetronad-dedicated/server_info.cfg , enable GLOBAL_ID 1 and assign a USER_LEVEL <username>@forums <level>. To login, type \"/login forums\" when connected to the server in-game (Using the menu didn't work for me).

For them, you trigger the login procedure with chat commands. There are three variants. Plain \"/login\", will trigger authentication for a local server account. \"/login <authority name>\", will trigger login with an account at a remote authority. In both cases, you'll have to enter your username at the password prompt, it will default to your current screen name (and due to a quirk, you will rename to the selected username after you logged in). The third way is to say \"/login <account@authority>\", this will try to log you log in as that, and preselect the username for you in the menu (in theory. This works for new clients only, sorry).

If you are using an old client make sure that when you are prompted for a password that your username is correct. On older clients this will rename it to your gridname. Ensure that you are using the correct authority where you have an account. Benefits Can vary. In default server settings, the only benefit you get is that the server can track you better in the hightscore tables.

The original protocol that old clients support, however, was designed to be used on a small group of trusted servers, and that makes it vulnerable to attacks from the side of the server. The one attack that is easily possible basically works like this: as you enter a server, the server badmin uses a modified client to play on another server. as you trigger the authentication procedure, the badmin does the same on the other server. the badmin's server relays the communication between the other server and the badmin's client to your client, and your response is routed back. That way, the badmin will be logged on to the other server with your user account.

Their condition: players from Germany would only be allowed to use the master server and play on the game servers with an account at Krawall.

I found no source for it, but I remember a while back Tank produced a modified client that was able to authenticate over the Krawall protocol with accounts on the forums.

Either way, legitimate instant kills are much more rare that nobody should have a problem ignoring them if we decide not to count instant kills. Finally, I wanted to watch the tournament but most of the matches ended up being completely private. Lag is a main issue, but I think this tournament has an important interest in not being private. As far as I know, this isn't a private tournament, and although we may need to limit spectating, I don't think the policy should be the privacy we"

In order to reach that number of players, we need something like a marketing strategy. Is it through word of mouth... through advertising.. can players encourage others to join by posting invitations in other game forums? At the root of it all, however, is the game itself. It is essential that the first experience a player has of the game is a pleasurable one, and hence some thought must be paid to how new players are treated. Inviting new players onto teams, informing them of the Ladle, may provide the right support for them to have fun and develop as players, and thereby increase the level of competition globally. We need new players! Some players have taken it upon themselves to start up new teams, recruiting noobs, training them up, and hopefully presenting a team that might win the much-sought-after Tronic Bowl!

Grinding Grinding is such a basic part of the game that it's the first area for you to focus on. If you can't grind well, you can't accelerate well, it's as simple as that. Grinding can be defined as \"Getting as close to the wall as possible without crashing, and turning so that you are running parallel to the wall\". This is for any player's wall as well as the Rim Wall. In order to grind, you approach a wall and actually hit it. At the moment of contact with the wall, there will be a slight pause before your cycle explodes into pieces. The length of that pause is"

So the longer you wait before turning, the closer you will be to the wall after you turn. Grinding is also a tactic, as well as a basic maneuvering skill. As a tactic, it's fairly straightforward. To seal someone in a box, you have to grind the open points on the box, closing the box. To drive someone into a corner (any corner, not necessarily the grid corners) you have to grind both sides of the corner, leaving one side with enough space for the player to reasonably get in it and sealing the other side so they can't turn without hitting your wall. Grinding as a tactic can be effective, but is also easily defeated by better grinding, so while you need to build this skill first, it's a skill you should work on intermittently on its own. Instead, focus on working grinding into the rest of your tactics, where it will serve you best. More information can be found on the Grinding page.

As you pick up speed, it becomes harder to grind any wall you approach, because the magical period during which you have struck the wall but haven't crashed is reduced in time, requiring faster moves to make the grind. Speed isn't used as a standalone tactic, generally. It is part of every move you ever make, however. A speed kill is generally associated with a pretty simple kill that you earned through the advantages conveyed by high speeds, but the kill itself is usually very basic in nature. If your speed is high enough compared to the bike you've targeted, it is possible to build all four sides of the box around that bike before they escape and/or attack you directly. To build skills at different speeds, you want to work in both an open grid and a pretty confined grid. The open grid will give you plenty of opportunities to work on grinding at high speeds, and the confined grid will give you plenty of opportunities"

Building Speed With a Launcher One of the best ways to build up speed is by folding back on your trail and driving between a gap for an extra speed boost. (Also called a slingshot) The basic maneuver goes like this. First, you head straight in one direction for a little bit- the longer you make it, the faster you will come out. Once you have gone far enough, do a 180 and follow your trail back almost to the end. Next, do a 180 into your last wall like you are going to box yourself. Then do a 180 towards the wall you are grinding now which will take you out of your box and shoot you out a lot faster then you went in.

Mazing can be defined as maneuvering at close quarters, but that's not entirely accurate. Maneuvering is as much navigation as it is simple turning. The right moves can be found to kill everyone at any speed in any situation, so this is easily the most important skill you need to build. It's also the most basic skill of the game, so you will always be working on it. Maneuvering as a tactic comes in three flavors: mazing, attack, and defense. Mazing is both an attack and a defense, and there's a fine line between a good mazer and a damn camper.

Take out as many opponents are you can before your flag is captured. And when it is, die immediately to stop the round and prevent the flag from scoring. If your opponent has slow reflexes the round will end, stopping a flag-run. If not, you and your team will be alive again. Take back your flag space! 2v4 When down by two players, it's tempting to try and re-spawn your mates. Don't, unless you are playing a weaker team and you can break the base-camp in a few seconds. The best thing to do is for both players to protect the flag, You'll probably kill a bunch more and hopefully negate any flag points they might get later. 2v4 Alternatively, when facing a team 2v4 (with your defense still up), you can base-camp.

Team Captains are encouraged to use the Challenge Board to establish the provisional games to be played that night (Sun 3rd Sept). Otherwise Team Captains will have to organise play-offs by visiting the common chat-room to ensure all teams turn up and deal with any problems that may arise. If the preparations are abused in any way, then let us rely on Team Captains to organise it as they did in the first Ladle. One critical problem to solve: recruiting last-minute. I was most disheartened to discover that one of AW's established team-mates was effectively locked out of a server because it was full. We must be more careful about last-minute additions, as well as recognise that without these last-minute recruits the Ladle would have crashed at the outset. So... any practical suggestions..?

Captain's Lock One simple rule: The Captains are the last player of their team to enter the server, and by doing so, they will fill the server and effectively lock it. That is, a match will only start when both Team Captains have entered the grid. During the time the Captain is out of the server, there can only be a maximum of 7 players since team-mates need to leave a space for the captain. Hence, the server will always remain open for last-minute additions and for late team-mates to join. The Team Captain should be in some form of communication with team-mates, whether it is a chat-room, team-speak, Skype, IRC, or whatever.

If, however, they lack a player or two, they have the opportunity of going around the different servers and doing some last minute recruiting. Their team should fill out and eventually the other team-mates will tell the captain they have 7 players and the Captain can return to the server, being the 8th member of the team, filling the server, and thus starting the match. This system should allow the flexibility for team-mates who are a little late. If, while the Team-Captain is out recruiting, a regular team-mate arrives, the team can ask any last-minute additions to leave, while still retaining the space for the 8th player -- the Team Captain. Of course, this doesn't work if we field teams with less than 8 players. The only solution using this system is to limit the number of players per team on the actual server and therefor we require the assistance of the admin. a.o.b.

Applying If you've ever taken part in a job interview you know that you have to emphasize your strengths and the important facts. 1. Don't lie about your clanhistory, it's unimportant as long as you don't turn out to be a clanhopper. 2. The phrase \"important facts\" includes your nicknames (which shouldn't be more than three so they don't cause confusion), the divisions you want to be part of and the number of years you've played"

You can also mention how you discovered the clan or why you want to join but you have to understand that a clan doesn't make exceptions if one of your relatives or best friends is already a clanmember. 4. There is only one good reason for everyone to join a clan which is to have fun together in tourneys and organized matches, usually clanwars (competitive aspect). If that's not one of the reasons why you want to join, stay out. 5. A clan expects its players to be active on the forum and in the game, otherwise it couldn't take part in any tourney. If you don't post anything else except your application you can be 100% sure that it will be rejected sooner or later. 6. The text of the application itself shouldn't be annoying, a clan doesn't care if you use a formal or informal style but it has to be proper (no special font size, colors you can read easily on this background, don't write all in caps unless you want everyone to interprete it as a shout). 7.

Most clans don't care as long as you aren't known as a reported pain in the neck. 9. Skill is not all. Clans don't accept immature behaviour. 10. The points listed above and below this one are only guidelines. Remember that a clan can also ignore your application without giving you a reason (if a clan just doesn't like you for example). 11. Speak for yourself. If other people try to force the clan to accept you they will most likely not do so. 12. Being part of a clan means also to be part of its up and downs. a clan need dedicated members. If you are unhappy or disappointed about something, go ahead and talk about it! 13. Most clans won't kick inactive members for their inactivity. Some clans have an \"inactives\"-list. 14.Administrators can check your IP, E-Mail address and collect information from other clans about you.

If you leave a clan because you cannot play in its most frequented servers, don't join. 17. Most clans accept both American and European players. But your continent shouldn't be a reason to leave the clan. If you can't play in US/Euro lag, then you can't really play. 18. Don't be complacent. Servers Clan servers seem to have become a status symbol for clans, but originally they emerged when clans realised that they need a place to play together without being distracted (or distracting someone else). Many servers are provided by clans, some are popular, some aren't. An advantage of these servers is that you are nearly always able to find an admin when you need one, provided that there are enough members of the server's related clan around. Clanwars Clanwars are the reason why so many clans exist. As a matter of fact, many players like to compete with opponents who are on the same level, but first they need a reliable, well-organised team. However, the other side of the medal is"

    "text": "a usually big gap between the effort players put in regular games and the attention they pay during clanwars (since they want to win by all means). This is why some players think regular games are less fun than clanwars, ignoring that it's their own fault. In other words, playing with non-clan-affiliated players isn't any different when they are doing their best to win. Sadly, some players don't like clans in general :-( But their reasoning shouldn't be left out here: it's known that some clans just exist on the purpose to assume an air of superiority. That's not entirely wrong, but those clans are usually disliked by most other players (clan-affiliated or not). And in the past, this kind of clan never could establish itself in the same way others could. Recruits/Trainees Be honest, friendly and apply only when you think you're as good as the other players of the clan. Some clans have a trainee system for potential members. \"Trainee\" is someone who isn't up to scratch yet and needs to be \"trained\", and therefore doesn't have access to the members area. A good player who has been playing for a very long time usually doesn't need to"

It's also an extra hassle for him when he doesn't deserve it, giving him an incentive to look at another clan. To really learn about someone, you need more than 2 or 3 weeks. During that 2 or 3 weeks, it's quite possible they'd only end up playing in 1 or even 0 organised matches with your clan, meaning you'd learn practically nothing about them and they learn nothing about you. There's nothing to stop you asking an applicant to play in an organised match on your clan's team, to help in that decision. This would naturally raise the barrier in terms of the quality of players your clan accepts. ~ .pRu|Phenomenon Usually new players are tested in fortress to estimate their skills in defending, attacking and general fighting.

Divisions and Division Leaders A division is a subgroup of the clan which is \"specialised\" in playing in a certain category of servers. Currently the most common divisions are Fortress, Sumo, Capture The Flag, Dog Fight, High Rubber and Deathmatch (aka classic Last Man Standing). The Division Leader's job is to sign up his team for upcoming tournaments, to announce it and to get the team together. They can declare sumo wars or accept challenges coming from other clans. They are usually the team captains during the game so they are supposed to have a good overview and a tactical understanding, considering that the server in which the team plays requires certain strategies. They can also play a decisive role in the recruitment of new members - forum-activity is a must. Otherwise you all have to do it on your own. Clansite If you have a clan, you should get one!

A disadvantage of being in a clan is that you're associated with everything your clan does which means you could become the scapegoat although some other member of your clan caused the trouble. If you don't want to be responsible for someone else's misbehaviour you can either just distance yourself from it or you expel that player out of the clan. A typical clan hierarchy Tips for clanleaders How many members does your clan have right now? 9? Here's my advice: try to expand fast, but make reasonable decisions and test/train your members regularly. 1) Find out what your members are best at eg which position they like and where they can improve. 2) If you play fortress or ctf: make a 3vs3 (attack vs def) whenever you have enough (it doesn't work when you tell them to show up, say, every sunday) 3) when you have a clanwar or tourney, use some time to think about your line up and the best choice for each position (you can make instant chats for that so you don't forget it later and don't need to check the forum while we play). 4) Understand the function"

Recruit new players and be able to control your anger :-D Why people leave clans - once you are part of the clan, you are associated with all of its members actions. This means whenever someone of your collegues causes trouble, you are automatically part of the problem - the bigger part of the clan plays at a different time of the day because they come from another continent. - other clans make your clan look bad so you join them after feeling embarrassed. - you feel like everyone in your clan tries to become the new leader and nobody appreciates what you have"

One unit in a direction is the same amount of pixels than one unit in any other direction. <Size> gives the size of the widget. The units are also squares of pixels. <Align> defines what point in the widget corresponds to the point that was positionned with the two first tags. If unspecified, it defaults to the center of the widget. Anchor and Position Not all players play Armagetron on the same kind of display. Some play it on a 4:3 resolution, while others use 16:9 or 16:10. Or they could be playing splitscreen, causing each player's cockpit to be 2:3 or 32:9.

Usually cockpit widgets are put near corners or edges of the output area. To help you do that, the <Anchor> tag lets you tell Armagetron just that. For instance: <Anchor x=\"-1\" y=\"-1\" /> Setting the anchor at -1,-1 tells Armagetron that you are about to put your widget near the bottom left-hand side of the output. If you put it at 1,1, then you'd be in the upper right-hand side. Here is the coordinate space used for the anchor tag, on 4:3 and 16:9 outputs, respectively: It will always scale to have x=-1 at the left, x=1 at the right, y=-1 at the bottom and y=1 at the top of the output.

Adjusting position and size depending on aspect ratio The <Anchor> tag also accepts minadjust and maxadjust attributes. When the widget is processed, its <Position> and <Size> are multiplied by a factor. This factor is determined by dividing the output height by its width, then clamping that value so that it is at least minadjust 's value and at most maxadjust 's value. Those attributes both default to 1, so that no change is made by default. For instance, a widget is positioned and sized like this: <Anchor x=\"0\" y=\"-1\" minadjust=\"0.1\" maxadjust=\"0.7\" /> <Position x=\"0\" y=\"0.1\" /> <Align x=\"0\" y=\"-1\" /> <Size x=\"0.5\" y=\"0.5\" /> If the output size is 1024x768(or any 4:3 aspect output), the factor is 768/1024 = 0.75 .

Traditionally, these were referred to as the HUD, and the HUD is still the main information that's carried in a cockpit file. In the resource file, gauges and other things have been abstracted to a Widget. Each Widget is capable of displaying all of the information you're used to seeing, and is likely capable of displaying the same information in different formats...thanks to the cockpit resource file. Overview of the Cockpit file The cockpit file consists of two sections. Technically they're just one, but you don't really have to worry about that. The two sections are pretty simple. The first just hooks it into the resource system for the whole game, using tags and stuff you may already know from the map files. The second section contains all the beautful cockpit stuff.

As an example, you might want to build a \"Performance\" gauge that includes ping, frames per second, cpu usage, overall system load, and bandwidth usage. That would require placing several widgets together, stacked on top of each other or on each other's sides, to build the conceptual Performance gauge you intend. Here, we'll use \"gauge\" to refer to a specific gauge and \"widget\" to refer to the larger conceptual gauge. Most widgets that you'll build will just be gauges, so it's not a big deal.

The tags that are available vary from gauge to gauge, but the meaning of each tag never varies. Two gauges that are diametrically opposite to each other might interpret the tag differently, but it will still mean the same thing for both gauges. That's an important subtlety that you should keep in mind. Construction of a Gauge Each gauge is a layered affair. In technical terms, first the back of the gauge is painted. Then the middle is painted on top of the back, and finally the front is painted on top of the middle. This is intended to allow for complete configurability for each gauge. The middle layer is always the representation of the data, whatever it is. The back and front are equivalent in size and shape and are intended for window-dressing. By painting a texture with alpha-blended pixels it should be possible to reshape parts of the gauge and give it a unique appearance. Two gauges can be identical in all ways except which texture is used for the front and have very different appearances to the user."

While you don't have to use a table to build the gauge, the table allows you to organize it in rows and columns, which is the most useful way to organize data that you expect to read only in glances. Each gauge has to specify which piece of data it displays, along with related pieces of data, and how to display them. This can vary dramatically! As an example, on the old HUD, in the rubber gauge, you saw a needle with some text to show the amount of rubber currently used. Then you had a minimum, which was 0, and a maximum, which varied from server to server. In the new rubber gauge you'll choose an appropriate widget and tell it where to get its minimum, its maximum, and its current data. Technically this is implemented with callbacks so that any data can be made available to be used by a gauge, even if it doesn't make sense to do so, and the callback name to use is what you'll give it in the cockpit file. If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it. Just make"

The primary purpose is to allow the internal camera to actually appear like you're inside the light cycle while providing minimal HUDs for the other cameras, and it's this purpose from which the name \"cockpit\" is derived. But you shouldn't let that block your creativity when you're creating your own nice cockpit.

Some data sources are only available in “all” mode, but you might not want a separate map for each player, so choose “top” then. “cycle” is a special viewport, it means that the widget will be rendered over every cycle, just like the label (name). The orign of the coordinate system will be right above the centre of the label in this case. General Gauge Information Every gauge supports an interpretation of some tags that are needed for every gauge. We'll discuss those here. Data Source The DataSet tag is a container that contains AtomicData tags. It defines all of the data that will be used to construct the gauge and may contain from 1 to 3 AtomicData tags within it. Here's an example: <DataSet> <AtomicData field=\"source\" source=\"player_speed\" /> <AtomicData field=\"minimum\" source=\"0\" /> <AtomicData field=\"maximum\" source=\"max_speed\" /> </DataSet> As you can see, each AtomicData tag contains"

This is easier to understand by just reading the snippet given, where \"player_speed\" will put the player's cycle's current speed in the field \"source\", but it will just put \"0\" in the field \"minimum\". This snippet is a speed gauge, and you can easily visualize a needle with 0 on the left, \"max_speed\" on the right, and the player's current speed marked by the needle itself as on the old HUD. A DataSet can have an id associated with it that you can use to refer to it later for presentation. This is most important in a Label.

The point given by position represents the center of the gauge. Don't forget this! It's common for the position point of a widget to be the top left corner, but that is not the case. Here, it's the center of the gauge. An example says everything that needs to be said: <Position x=\"-0.165\" y=\"-0.9\" /> <Size height=\"0.15\" width=\"0.15\" /> Positions and sizes are not in pixels, but in units of a special coordinate plane. The point at the bottom left is always (-1, -1) and the point at the bottom right is always (1, -1). So the x- coordinate always goes from -1 (left) to 1 (right).

In this example, minimum is always 0 and maximum is always 1, and current is always something in between. In order to compute the size of the gauge for the purpose of drawing the bar, you must have AtomicData for all three fields as discussed above. But you may not want to present that data.

In addition to the middle layer you have the background and foreground layers in which you can draw, and they are done with the aptly named Background and Foreground tags.

Here are some examples: A solid foreground color, red, with no alpha transparency. <Foreground> <Solid> <Color r=\"1.\" g=\"0.\" b=\"0.\" alpha=\"1.\" /> </Solid> </Foreground> A lightly transparent 3-color gradient.

You don't really need to know much more than that 0xff0000 has more Red than 0xaa0000, and stuff like that. See Bases if you do want learn more about hex. Developer's note: these color codes were not intended for use by the players; the choice of 0x as intro string was a bit unfortunate. Some servers will filter away your codes, so do your testing in a local game. Since it was not intended for use, no thought was given on usability, and for example upper case codes are not accepted.

When engaging others, it is all too often the case that people present obstacles and objections AS IF the other person is not aware of them. It is a natural part of communication, that we can only present one thing at a time, consciously. Hence, when describing an elephant I may start off describing it's trunk; it would be premature and disrespectul if someone was to object and point out that it has large ears. Too many discussions are of this template, and the way to avoid it here, is to ensure that you merely present your solution, positively and constructively. If you can improve on an idea already presented, then edit it; if you have thought of an alternative solution, then write a new page. contention decisions At some critical points, decisions need to be made. Making decisions in the unformed space of potentiality, is a tricky business. All too often, people are making decisions based on half-understood facts, prejudgements, and ignorance.

There are many things you can do to attract or repel potential players to/from your server. I found most of this self-explanatory, and one thing I like about Armagetron is the truly wide variety of things you can do to make a server unique. This text doesn't address server physics, which is an even more subjective matter- just aesthetics. How to Properly Season Your Server Name The server name will be a major defining factor in making a first impression, and thus drawing people in who haven't played in your server before. Of course it shouldn't be too long, nor should one have tons of servers with the same name. This is regarded as spam, and can lead to a ban. Servers that are meant to be part of a 'group' or operated by one clan can be grouped visually, just by using a similar prefix or a color code which is repeated.

Let's start a small design analysis with CTWF: The server name consists of 8 different color codes, changing from letter to letter, but with consistent order from word to word. It's not a smooth color gradient, but a contrast symbolizing the 'craziness' of the server and its 'weird maps' that are mentioned in the server options. CTWF is a very successful server, and subjectively, the coloring of the name may be a significant factor in this. However, it should be noted that many of the more attractive server names use color in less extreme ways. If you wish to keep the general bulk of players away from your server, there are three ways to achieve this: 1. Changing max_clients to a low number to restrict number of players (or 0, to only allow players already in the server) 2. Set talk_to_master to 0 so the server doesn't appear on the list (Note: players would have to know, and manually enter, the server's IP in order to play there) 3. Changing the server name to reflect this and hope people take heed"

The welcome message can be very useful in informing players about the server they are entering, or just look spiffy. You can utilize ASCII art (as used in Wild West Capture The Flag) or give a detailed description of your game (like in many Fortress servers or Dodgeball). One may also advertise their clan site, or a way to contact the administration of the server. Server Options If you happen to use your server logs for an IP Finder, you should point it out in the server options. Good servers often have a short description of the most important settings (rubber, zones, big/small arena, score or time limit, speed, team size...) or a humorous slogan (CTWF: There's like all these weird maps man! ) Ping Limits A ping limit is a bad idea. Who knows what players you will never meet because you obstruct your server's door? Imagine Xyron would be banned from all sumo servers.

While settings are always valid, regardless if they are popular or not, rules have to be enforced by server admins and moderators. If server staff interfere too frequently, players may stay away completely (see: Playing Open ). However, all of this is my personal opinion and it's your choice what you do with your server. Rules should be clearly dictated in the welcome message, and preferably also in the server options (alternatively, if rules are short and simple, in round_console_message). Nobody likes to be kicked for \"closing\" or \"stabbing\", particularly when rules weren't clearly defined to begin with. Our internet society isn't so rotten that you have to add good behaviour to the rules. But it can have a positive effect on the server's climate if admins are there to handle your players' issues and to ensure they don't degrade others, teamkill, or otherwise ruin their armagetron experience with their n00bery. Having a list of people to contact in cases of severe n00bery can be helpful. Center Messages Center messages should be used rather sparingly, perhaps for a short URL or clan name."

The Early Days The first homepage of CT actually was a Google group and shorty afterwards a Yahoo group. Later Xevi made a forum hosted on Ed's plantpeanuts.co.uk. and since 13. July 2006 we have crazy-tronners.com. One Year Later More servers were created like special ones for various tournaments. The clan grow and got more and more members. The Reformation In the middle of 2007 we realized that we got more like a bunch of people who just play Armagetron once in a while and talk in our forum about whatsoever. More and more Armagetron players just joined our clan to wear the CT tag and felt cool and better than other ordinary non-clan players just because they were"

Drastic measures had to be taken to establish a new spirit. New rules were defined and some members were kicked out of the clan. A lot changed inside CT. Today We are a strong clan that attends at tourneys and does clan wars. We have enough active players for clan wars and internal battles which is a lot of fun. Our server techs are up to date and help developing Armagetron so it gets better and better. Our servers belong to the most popular ones out there."

Here on this wiki, we have the page for players to go to find competitions, and it's open for everyone to participate. We also provide a way for people to organize their competitions, if they'd like. You can use this wiki to organize, sign up players, give news and results, etc. You don't have to, but you are strongly encouraged to include your competition on the Competition Hub page so that players will know about it.

Create a long page that gives information about the competition. Put your informational page in 2 categories of a certain format to get it put on the calendar. Information on each of these steps is in the next 3 sections. Create a Blurb Page This is the most important part. :) To do this, put your pointer in the url bar of your browser, delete the current page title from the url, and put the title for the page you want to create. Then hit \"Go\", and you will be taken to a page that says \"This page hasn't been written yet\". Edit that page and put your competition in it. The only requirement for this page is that it be short, and organized. You should use a table, you should use a table formatted like the others that are there. Those aren't requirements, though.

It's also very useful to put basic information about the competition on a longer, more general-purpose page that users can read about. It's also a good place to put news about the competition, such as posting who the winners are! This page should transclude your blurb page to start itself. Your blurb page should also contain a link to this page. If you intend to do all of your player signups and related organization somewhere else, then this longer page should state clearly and explicitly that players cannot sign up here, and it should provide a link to the appropriate place to do so.

Do it like this: [[Category:Competitions]] [[Category:Tournaments]] Put it on the Calendar! If you haven't noticed by now, there's a very nice calendar on the Competition Hub page that shows at a glance the upcoming events. It's intended primarily for competitions, and whenever you schedule an event, you should mark it there. There are several ways to approach this. If you need every event marked on the calendar to have special information about the event, you'll need to create new pages for each event. If you just want to put your Competition Summary page on the calendar, then that's all you need to do. As an example, the Ladle is a monthly competition, and each Ladle is numbered, with a new page created for each event. Each of these new pages are included on the calendar separately.

The second line, in YEAR/MONTH/DAY format, contains the actual day the event will occur. Please note that you need to create a longer informational page to include your event on the calendar, you cannot use your blurb page. This is sadly a technical limitation, if you use your blurb page, then the Competition Hub itself will be placed on the calendar, and this is useless cruft.

The easiest way around this is to first install the original moviepack (get the ZIP) and install the moviepack you actually want on top of it . Unix/Linux In Unix based Operating Systems, where file case is important, sometimes a texture doesn't display even though it appears to be installed correctly. to correct this, manually change the case of the file to suit. In particular, upper case extensions can cause problems. ie, change filename.JPG to filename.jpg and it will probably be OK. If settings.cfg is partially or completely capitalized, no textures will load even if they are properly capitalized. You should inform the author of the moviepack of the problem so he can fix it. Installing a new model In your Armagetron Advanced moviepack directory (see above) locate bike.png and cycle.ase and replace with the new ones. It is important to note that there must be an existing moviepack installed to single update to a new model.

Use transparency wisely There are several things to keep in mind when using transparent textures: Because of to the way OpenGL prevents background objects from drawing over foreground objects, it might not be possible to see everything through a transparent texture. Colors will bleed from neighboring texels (texture pixels) if both color and transparency are different. An exception to this is the cycle texture, which is preprocessed by the game and has no transparency in the end. Cycle Colors The basics of cycle color First you have to understand how computers understand colors. In armagetron, colors are saved with three values: the red , green and blue (R, G and B) parts.

So how do you set these colours ? you can set them via the player setup menu, but if you want to have different cycle and trail colours, you have to use the Console . The commands are color_r_1 X # set red component of the 1st player's cycle to X color_g_1 Y # set green component of the 1st player's cycle to Y color_b_1 Z # set blue component of the 1st player's cycle to Z The best way to learn how"

Well, that was not entirely true. If you set a color to a value over 15, the trail part is set to 15 and the cycle is (usually) set to the actual value minus 16. For example: r 16 g 16 b 0 : yellow tail (r 15 g 15) and black bike (16 - 16 = 0) higher numbers can give you multi-colored trails. Again, experiment. For an exact explanation, see elaborate color explanation . Developer's note: this behavior of the game is technically a bug and is officially unsupported. It is tolerated, though, because it's fun :) But some servers, especially team play servers where your color is no mere decoration, will clamp your color settings to 15 and this trick does not work.

But what if you want to make semi-permanent changes to settings you might type into the Console ? The answer is the autoexec.cfg file. Here is how it use it: 1. Locate the configuration directories. Launch Armagetron and select \"About\" from the main menu. This will list directories where Arma stores/reads data. The configuration directory you want access to is usually in your $HOME folder (this is dependent on your operating system).

There is nothing special about CFG files, they can be edited with any simple text editor like Notepad on Windows. Armagetron looks for and loads this file when it starts. Any settings you put in there will override default values. 3. Add your custom settings. Some of the most common setting are for Custom Camera (rise, pitch, etc.). You can see a list of these and many, many more on the Console Commands page. Put each setting on it's own line followed by a space, then the value of your choice. Save the file when finished. 4. More settings. autoexec.cfg will also override settings in your user.cfg. You can copy instant chats, your player name, even keybindings found in user.cfg to autoexec.cfg and modify them without breaking your user.cfg file. 5. Advanced usage. You can have any number of config files in the directory alongside of autoexec.cfg, with any name you choose. This is helpful if you want a modular setup.

The trick behind a good cut, where one cuts the defense through a very small gap, is not to aim for the gap itself, but the end of the tail. When you hit the end of the tail of another cycle you start using up rubber, and if you time it just right the tail has gone out of the way before your rubber is up, and the road is clear for you to enter the zone. The effectiveness of a cut depends largely on the speed of the attacker when entering the zone, when the attacker has alot of speed there is big chance that the defender is killed by the suprise alone. If the defender does not die instantly the attacker has little trouble putting the defender in a small box (and most probably killing him) while taking the lions share of the zone.

Before one has set up a proper Overlapping Defense though, the attacker has two ways to force a gap. The first one is when the defender is expanding his zone and driving at the outside of his tail. When an attacker approaches in this short timespan the defender will do a 180 degrees turn against his own wall to keep the attacker out, he must then turn around again to follow his tail. The second turn is very hard to time right because the defender doesnt want to risk doing it too early and still being on the outside, so there is a big chance there will be a gap for a very limited time. This is when the attacker cuts it. The second way involves the dent in the defense because of his teammates tails. {TO DO}"

Haze was a well known shooter considered one of the best but had multiple alias back then so no one truly knew who he was. Due to his renown everyone wanted him recruited for a clan but denied all and decided to make his own. During late 2010 Vinny disappeared and this caused Haze to take the reigns and start new by renaming the clan to Dark Legion. Mainly all top shooters joined Haze in his clan and remained a top 3 shooting clan, but around the year of 2012 Haze quit to pursue a fort career in tron. Leaders that took over was Torn and Jcool. Together they kept Dark Legion alive as long as they could. Sadly by mid 2014 Dark Legion finally died Haze rejoined to help Jcool but the game mode High Rubber Shooting was no longer active.

But the first two limitations are so severe that it plainly doesn't make sense to improve the usability of debug recording playback into that direction, and the changes would all make more code aware that a debug recording is running, which is a bad thing for debugging.

    "text": "Contents 1 Overview 2 Technical Description 3 Practical Considerations 3.1 Attack Vector 3.1.1 Proxy Attack (Resolved) Overview This proposal uses digital signatures to enforce uniqueness of names. It is a hierarchical and distributed system, but the actions of the root node are subject to public review and can be accepted/rejected individually. We consider two players for purposes of explanation. Alice would like her name to be unique, and uses the authentification system to that purpose. Bob uses the authentification system to find out if the player who claims to be Alice really is Alice. This system is based on trust. Both Alice and Bob trust the involved parts the auth system that only Alice may play under the name Alice. Since trust is a personal and subjective thing, both Alice and Bob can individually decide which server(s) in the authentification system they trust, and, by consequence, which server(s) in the authentification system are used. The authentification system manages identities. Every identity has a name and a full name. An authority is an identity that can create new identities. A correct authority creates identities with identical names only if it is convinced that the requesting player is identical. An identity's full"

(For instance, if the authority with full name \"fe\" created an identity named \"meriton\", the latter's full name would be \"meriton.fe\"). As a consquence, if all ancestors of an identity are correct, the identity has a unique full name. Technical Description Be sure to understand the concept of digital signatures before you proceed. In public, an identity is represented using the name, the time of expiration, the public identity that created it and a public key, digitally signed by the creating identity. In private, an identity additionally knows the matching private key. A correct authority does not reveal private knowledge. Alice can create an identity for herself using the following protocol: Alice chooses a name, a time of expiration, a parent identity, a secret and a matching public key, and sends the name, the public key and any other information that may be required to her parent identity the parent identity, if it choses to satisfy the request, sends Alice the signature she needs for her public identity Note: A valid identity can only be created"

Bob verifies Alice's identity using the following protocol: Bob chooses a random number and sends it along with her game id to Alice Alice digitally signs the message using her private key and sends that signature along with her public identity to Bob Bob verifies the signature using the public key in the shown public identity. In addition, he verifies the identity's validity by verifying all signatures and expiration times therin and that he trusts its root identity. If all checks succeed, he is satisfied. If Alice's trust was not misplaced, i.e. all ancestor identities are correct, and Bob trusts Alice's oldest ancestor, Alice can convince Bob of her full name. If Alice's trust was not misplaced, only Alice can convince Bob of her full name. Proof: That Alice can convince Bob should be obvious. Why can't Eve? Since Alice is correct, Eve does not know Alice's secret key, and therefore can only sign Bob's challenge if she can persuade Alice to help, which she can't [1]. Furthermore, Eve can not create a public identity bearing Alice's full name: Alice's identity ancestors are correct, and the root ancestor's identity is known to Bob. Eve"

The installer copies a default set. Anyone can create an identity that is its own root. if Bob does not trust the root identity, his client marks the display name (if identity verification failed for another reason, the identity is forged and a message to Bob might be in order). Bob can define a standard root identity, whose contribution to display names is omitted in case a name collision can be ruled out. a clan can manage its own namespace within the full names by hosting its own authority and narrow its acceptance criteria there is no communication between Bob and any authority. (-> Privacy) if a private key is leaked, there is no means of damage control short of asking players to remove the root key from the trusted set. By neccessity, any protocol where Bob does not contact a predefined server has that flaw.

    "text": "An example DB setup In Armagetron, a player may bind more than one key to a turn direction. For example, binding two keys for a left turn, and then pressing them both simitaniously will result in a quick one-eighty turn-around. Double-binding has a long and glorious history smattered with a fair bit of controversy along the way. Players can bind as many keys as they want. Some players triple-bind which is great for making \"knots\" and in very rare cases people bind four keys (quad-bind), though the vast majority of players only double-bind. Also, players sometimes describe their turns as \"doubles\" and \"triples\" even if they only use one key each to make the turns. It can be a little confusing. Sometime people are describing their keyboard actions and sometimes the shape of their turns. History The earliest known double binder is Locutus. His reasoning was that since he had a bit of carpal tunnel syndrome, it was easier to play the game if he bound two or more keys to the same actions. So when he started doing it, it was to deal with a condition that might otherwise be considered disabling. You know, kinda like having one of"

It wields an eEventType and a list of arguments, a bit like tOutput s which have a name string, the context we caught/created this event from and a list of arguments. The eEventType class defines an event type. Really. There is a big list of all eEventType s so that you can name an eEventType using a string, but you don't have to worry about it anyway, the contructor's main role is to do that for you. So, an eEventType comports: a name string, which is used for transmission via eEvent s and for naming; it also has serval eEventHandler s, which will be used when the event is received.

These settings are 32-bit signed integers with range -2147483648..2147483647. Short color When a color is absorbed from the configuration items and stored in a player it is truncated to three 16-bit unsigned integers with range 0..65535. There is no benefit to choosing a color outside of that range in the configuration item. -65536 simply becomes 0, just like 65536 and 131072. -65535 and 65537 become 1, etc. I call"

That has been added mainly because overflows could result in drastic deviations from the team color. FIXME: is this entirely true and what is the config item? I only have old code. Without teams The float color is simply the short color divided by 15. With teams In a team game the short color is combined with the team color which is another short color.

Because the wall color is lit before it is clamped, walls placed in different directions can have different colors when there's a slight overflow.

It is unique in this regard, especially compared to the likes of CounterStrike and some other internet games. In those games, it is possible to hide somewhere and pick people off from a distance, accumulating points in the process and ultimately winning. In Armagetron Advanced, this is just not possible. The mechanics of the game prevent you from \"camping\" and picking off players. To get points, you have to go out and earn them, which requires the ability to be assertive. Another real life skill that is developed by Armagetron Advanced is the ability to think quickly. The ability to think quickly requires being able to analyze few bits of information (possibly insufficient bits of information), make a decision, and act on it.

Put succinctly, Armagetron is \"A Tron clone in 3D\". An more detailed explanation can be found on the About page. What is a client? What is a server? What's the difference? Simply put, the game client is the program you run on your computer. The game server runs on somebody else's computer. The difference between the two is like the difference between, say, a lawyer and his client. The lawyer would be the server, the one who knows all about law and stuff. So the difference is just like in real life where the terms come from. The client requests a service from someone who serves. In our case, that service is a game that is served from a machine running a program called a \"server\", but if you requested the same service from a person in a casino, you'd still be running a game client. My client can be a server, though, it says so right here. That's not a question. In any case, the game client can act as a"

So are all game servers just clients where people pressed \"Host Game\"? No. This is where people get really confused, even to the point where they complain to server operators for doing exactly this thing. No, most, if not all, game servers available through the master server run a special version of the program that has no graphical display, and no player can play on directly. That is the server, commonly called a \"dedicated server\". You can run one too, if you like. Server operators chose to run this instead of the regular game client because it has a number of modifications that make it work better as a regular server, just like a mail server or a web server. It is more convenient and makes for a more reliable game server to do so. Running the Game Client Where can I download Armagetron Advanced? That depends on what version you want to get.

AA takes all the CPU time it needs to simulate and render the scene as fast as you'll allow it to. There are two conditions under which that makes it take almost everything that is available: You set your graphics card driver not to wait for VSync. AA will then run at the highest possible framerate and therefore also use all the CPU time available. If you enable the FPS display in the HUD options and it shows more than 100 FPS, then that's your problem. When it tells your video card driver to update the screen now, the driver goes into a special CPU-hogging mode until the command is completed, even though all it does is sit around and wait.

This can be a problem on the new Dual Core Systems or malfunctioning Multiprocessor System. The Timer of each core runs at different speeds which results in a jumping timer! The AMD X2 Systems are affected because they have two separate timers for each CPU (Intels Core Duo CPUs share a single timer).

If your server is connected to the internet via a router box and not directly via a \"modem\" of sorts, it is likely that network packages from the internet can't get to your server because the router blocks them. You need to tell your router to forward UDP port 4534 (or whatever SERVER_PORT is set to) to the server. On http://www.portforward.com , there are nice instructions how to do that for a lot of router models. If the UDP port 4534 thing confuses you, just follow these instructions for a different game that uses a similar connection method. Of course, you need to find out what router model you have, some under-the-table-crawling and cable following may be required for that if you can't remember what you bought"

Will there be support for the neat new cockpit in 0.2.8.x? No. The cockpit stuff is developed in the lp:armagetronad brach (called trunk) and is a major new feature there. Only bugfixes and very much needed features are added to 0.2.8.x versions. What about <feature X not in any of the 0.2.8 alphas/betas>? Will it be in 0.2.8? Same answer as above. There's a quite obvious and annoying problem in version 0.3.x, why isn't it fixed? That problem probably comes from some experimental code someone committed a bit too eagerly. It is not currently possible to easily fix the problem the right way, or we would have already done so. Before we can fix it properly, we either need to do some work elsewhere first (which you can bet we're doing) or the person responsible needs to find the time.

Disconnects are more common in this game style, so some leniency is given on disconnects. If a disconnect occurs, the two competitors will play a new, second official match, starting at 0-0. However, the second official match will not be the final score used in the tournament. Instead, the first player to reach 10-x points (x being the points they scored in the first official match) will be deemed the winner. The points of the other player, up until that point in time, will be added with the points they scored in the first official match. This point total, along with the combined 10 points of the winner, will be used to produce a final tournament score. All other points scored after the first player reaches 10-x points in the second official match will be disregarded.

On most common Fortress servers, the first team to reach 100 points wins the match. Core-dumping your enemy, you receive 2 points which also adds 2 points to the overall team score. Hole points have been recently introduced to some Fortress servers and seems to becoming a standard setting which gives you 1 point which also adds 1 point to the overall team score.

Using just \"/shuffle\" without a number, will just shuffle you out to the last position. When you join a Fortress server you will be placed on the very outside, so the others player's position won't be affected. Usually you're not allowed to shuffle \"up\" (to a lower pos). The most common way to change your position to a lower position is waiting until an inner player shuffles out. (He may be tired of Attacking) or until someone simply leaves the team. Recently, in some updated servers, you're allowed to shuffle up only once you have logged in through the Armathentication mechanism. However, it is a commonly accepted rule that you ask for your team-mates consense before taking his/her actual position. Note : expecially for newbies, the inner position the harder it"

This doesn't mean that starting from outside is \"easy\", in fact the outmost player is partially responsibile of letting the defender build the zone protection succesfully. Center/Centre As you might have guessed, center/centre (or middle) player starts from position #1. The initial phase, after splitting, is quite complicated for him: he has the chance to attack the opponents grinding through their attackers' walls, but he will have to prevent the opponent middle player from doing the same thing... Usually acting in a very tight space. In matches where both teams have 6-7 or more players it can become very hard to survive more than 10-15 seconds. Attacker Attackers start from positions 2 and 3. It is a good practice to try killing opponents' sweepers before attempting to break their defence. A good attacker is able to let his team win very quickly (when his base is well protected, of course). At start they can double grind , a technique that lets them gain a lot of speed, sometimes"

An attacker must have a good timing either to split well after the start, either to beat the enemy defence. Sweeper There are usually two sweepers, one for each side: e.g. in a team of 8 players, the defender takes position 8, while sweepers take 7 and 6. Sweepers are those who at start help the defender building the zone protection. After that, they will try to block the enemy attackers, giving their own mates more time to attack the other base. Sweepers' role is very stressful too, because angry-aggressive attackers will try everything to kill them: a defender being attacked by 2 (or more) attackers is easily going to fail without the support of (at least) one sweeper. Defender Usually starts from the outmost position, drives along the closest mate's wall until he/she reaches the zone limit. Then begins drawing a square around the zone, as fast as possible. The defender holds the most stressful role in forress. If he dies the round is usually lost.

Same principle, but in Fortress the setting have been set slightly lower than usual that you will only notice the speed boost when you grind quite close and for at least a few seconds. Grinding is one of the fundamental things in Fortress and everyone demands that you grind your team players and split correctly at the start of each round. If doing anything else, will most likely get you kicked or suspended. Wing (Winger) Sweep (Sweeper) The role of the Sweeper is to stay close to the Defender and help him fight off the enemy attackers. It's not the job of the Sweeper to defend the zone, that's up to the Defender! The best Sweepers are the ones who kill off enemies and be there when the Defender needs it the most. A good Sweeper ensures it blocks off the enemies attackers at the early stages in order to allow the Defender to properly set up his defence. Once the defence is set up, the Sweeper should go around"

That'll get you all killed. The second thing you need to do is figure out how you will all fire up gracefully. There are a couple of concerns you need to be thinking about, and they're very important. The first is that if you leave a space between your wall and any of your teammates' walls you leave a big hole that your opponents can and usually will use against you. A fast-moving opponent can sail through those holes before you get your defense setup. The second is how you will personally withdraw from the wingman configuration without hurting any teammates.

There are other sports with interesting parallels you might consider for position names, but why bother? We do go ahead and name the center position \"point\", although that is usually referred to in-game as \"center\". We make this difference so we can use the word \"center\" with impunity to mean \"center of the grid\". The team splits up into an offensive team and a defensive team, generally. With smaller teams, your defensive team will probably only be one or two players. Of course, that's 3-4 players on a team, which leaves only 2-3 players for offense. Keep in mind that number of 3 for offense, it will serve you. These numbers work for up to 5 players. On a larger team, you will generally will split up into three areas of influence.

First, they'll play a mid-field defense for a minute or so and be prepared to fallback to defensive positions if the defense needs them to. If not, they'll advance as the second-wave of attackers. Who's in charge? Generally, on a team with 3 or more players, someone needs to be in charge, and that someone needs to be reasonably close to point to be able to make the calls to separate the line. How that will happen depends largely on how the point wants to deploy his team and on how the team wants to deploy. At the time of writing, point calls aren't in common usage but they have been demonstrated to be very effective.

Players will sign up and get thrown into a player list. Designated team captains will choose from the player base. When signing up, players should give their tron alias, what position they would prefer to play, with their secondary position preference, so that team captains can have some idea of how their team will look. The team captains will be chosen by a discussion with a few prominent tron members. If they don't want to be a captain, they can decline. This changed from my original idea for people to say whether they want to be a team captain or not. In this way, hopefully we can get some really good team captains. The team captains will be asked after the sign-ups close. The team captains will need to be experienced and need to know all the key points of fortress."

His purpose isn't necessarily to attack and kill every opponent that comes his way, rather it's to prevent the attackers from passing. Sometimes, more often than not, it's easiest and best to kill the attacker. Occasionally, however, it's best to just deny access.

The point takes the first opportunity to turn left towards the enemy, hopefully he'll kill his counterpart on the other side when he does it. When he goes around the other team's flank, his guard follows, grinding his wall some more. The point then needs to go back to the middle area where the other team's long wall trail sits.

Left-side Rush The left-side rush is generally only possible in two situations. The first is that the other team hasn't grinded well on their right side. If they have, they will usually run a right-side rush against your team and your left side will instead be trying to hold it off. The second situation is through the use of a somewhat controversial method called double-grinding. This method has the potential, if done well, to block the other team's right-side rush, and set up a left-side rush for your team. It has the drawback that if it fails, your left side usually collapses. In the left-side rush, the point's left guard takes the lead in the wingman approach, and the player to his left is his wingman. Otherwise, this rush is the mirror image of the right-side rush. Center Rush There are two types of center rushes. First we'll talk about the point sneak, second we'll talk about the more general center rush. Point Sneak The Point Sneak is a favorite of many"

    "text": "players and is a pretty good attack in its own right. In the Point Sneak, the point player will bleed off his speed as soon as possible after break, then approach the other team's break point. He will then pick a place to grind, beat the other team's grinds in that place, and go right through the center of the wall trail. This has the significant advantage in that if he can beat those grinds, he will regain all of his speed and shoot out right in the middle of the other team's fortress, inside the goalie's defense. If he can keep his wits about him, he can usually wrap up taking the zone within a few seconds. The biggest drawback is that if your point is otherwise a strong player, and he fails, then you've lost a player. It also means one less player on the right, because the center didn't break right. The Point Sneak has some other main drawbacks that are worth considering. Most goalies are prepared for it, to begin with, because it's a common tactic. If the point starts his run too early, it's just a glorious way to commit suicide early in the round."

    "text": "If he starts too late, the goalie has closed off his fortress. So the timing has to be pretty good to get in. If not, this is a suicide attack. The second drawback is that it's very hard to gauge the level of grind needed to get in between those walls in the first place, and misgauging means death for the point. This is something of a blessing in disguise, other players can use the point's hole to advance. On the other hand, astute defensive players will go through the hole to deny this avenue entirely to your team. Center Rush The more general center rush is what usually develops when the left and right sides have both been deadlocked. Players on both of those sides will tend to turn around, leaving some to fight with the other team. The ones that turn around will form up in the center and make a center rush. \"Rush\" probably isn't the right word for it, it's usually more like a stately advance. Rushes in General The advantage to making rushing attacks in general is that you're sending in 2-3 players at a time at high speeds, usually against players that are of"

A successful early rush finishes the round, but an unsuccessful early rush can still result in peeling off some defenders. Some argue that the first rush isn't against the fortress anyway. It's against the prepared defenders. This argument has some merit, because generally the first wave of attackers against any prepared defense results in 50% casualties, if not more. So if you attack with all 5 offensive players on an 8-person team, you will lose 2-3 of them against the 3-man defense. What's left is parity in numbers, a long fight, and a serious possibility of losing your own fortress to superior numbers. If you instead send in 2 players on a rush, they have a good chance of defeating one or two defensive players, only lose 1 of their own, and then your second wave brings your offensive numbers up to 3 or 4 against only 1-2 defenders. Then there's the argument that 2 players rushing can get inside the other team's defensive line and seige the fortress without"

If they don't do that, the other team's defense will just close in around your 2 sneak attackers and wipe them out. Wingman Approach The wingman approach is an offensive formation, it's rarely useful as a defensive formation. In this approach, you have a leader and a wingman. The leader carves out the path to wherever it is you're going, and the wingman grinds his wall for speed. The leader generally has to find his own walls to grind for speed to keep his up, and if they're not there, the two will switch roles partway down. The leader is usually on the side of the pair nearest the other team's zone, that is to say, he's on the inside, and the wingman is on the outside. The leader will then try to get around whoever else is inside and close them off, if necessary he'll break formation to engage defenders while his wingman will continue to advance. In this case, the leader will rejoin his wingman as soon as possible"

He'll keep them off the leader's back, and even break formation to engage them, returning as soon as he can. Neither generally try to kill defenders, although neither will avoid the target of opportunity. Generally, though, they don't try to kill defenders. Instead, they try to isolate and neutralize defenders so they can continue their attack, because trying to kill a defender usually takes too long. It is common for a wingman approach to encounter defenders that block their avenue of advance completely. In this case, the two attackers have to deal with the obstacle directly. They can't leave a fighting force like this behind them to come and harass them, and they can't advance around them. There are many ways to deal with it, but they all boil down to one thing: one attacker stays and occupies them and the other attacker circles around in a flanking maneuver. If this doesn't work quickly, then it's a judgement call. Sometimes it's better to break up the wing at that point and fight as individuals for a time, sometimes it's better to stay together, eliminate"

If you find yourself attacking alone, or there's just you and the opponent's defense left (or you are having problems breaking the defense), a useful tactic to use is what I called the Defense Crush. This move can take time, but if you have troubles killing overlapping defenders, then it can be useful. Imagine a wavy defense, where it is basically a jagged shape (this works best on those kind of defenses). This tactic simply entails circling the defense as close as you can to the wall, similar to a double defense. Depending on how much rubber you are willing to spend, you may want to grind the walls to help the process along. as this happens, your opponent's defense should get tighter. As this happens, start closing in on them, like you are defending a shrinking zone, crumpling your Crush as they do their defense. Hopefully, they will box themselves in, and start having problems staying alive, and will eventually die. Despite this being a good tactic, it can take time, especially if the defender is good at sumo"

If there is low rubber, though, you need to keep a constant eye on the gauge, as it can run out very quickly. Of course, in Capture The Flag especially, if you see a crusher having a go at your defense, and if you are willing to lose your defender, start Double Crushing them. If they cotton on to what's happening before it's too late, they may even pull out, saving your player."

In addition to that, various administerial decisions will also be made by the Evil Triumvirate, with feedback from the development team and the community at large. Examples of such decisions are how to spend any revenue for the benefit of the project and only for individual profit when there is agreement from developers and the community that such is desired, how to organize the SCM system, giving new members of the development team commit access to the SCM system, and numerous other decisions along these lines. When the triumvirate steps in to make a decision, a decision is considered made when 2 of 3 of the Admins agree. To avoid the chilling effect that participation in regular development might cause, since it's a quite common situation for 2 or more of them to agree, a decision needs to be marked as requiring attention by the triumvirate.

Some of them are popular enough to have their own pages, others are just listed here. These are distinguished from game variations in that there isn't a way to directly support a competitive arena using any of these games. Instead they're usually played in arenas that have a certain set of physical characteristics, and players play these games without regard to scoring. Some of these grid games have scoring systems associated with them, but due to limitations in the game, it's very difficult to properly enforce either scoring or rules of the game.

Mazing Mazing is a grid game that has been around forever. No one knows who started it but it is still one of, if not the, most popular games. Tunneling This is a game played by 2 or more players. To tunnel Player A goes around Player B, trapping him in between Player A and Player B's wall. Player A follows the wall next to him where ever it goes, leaving enough space for Player B to safely travel through, until player B gets out. Player B then turns and goes around Player A and does the same thing. The concept is the same as mazing, but some people enjoy it more because you can tunnel more tunnels faster then if you had to make a bunch of mazes.

If your cycle is close enough to the wall you're grinding that it rubs against the wall, sparks and a sound effect will accompany the grind (if that setting is on).

An Example Fig. 1 right, gives a theoretical example of grinding against an opponents wall: Red travels in a straight line in one direction, and blue drives their cycle at right-angles towards red's cycle wall. At the very last moment, blue turns in the same direction as red, leaving as small a gap as possible between himself and red's wall. Blue now benefits from the acceleration effect of 'grinding' against red's wall, and will eventually overtake the red player if they continue in parallel. Grinding Hazards Although the acceleration gained from grinding is undoubtedly very beneficial in a game where your only weapon is the trail left behind you, it does decrease the amount of time that you have to react to certain situations. In the example given above, if the red player suddenly turned to the right and 'boxed in' the blue player, blue would have far less time to both see the turn and to react to it in time to avoid driving into the resulting perpendicular wall. For this reason, grinding an opponents wall and"

This is sometimes called a launcher or slingshot and players can often end up gaining a huge speed boost using this method, allowing them to quickly box in other players. Grinding the Rim/Outer/Grid Wall Some maps may have acceleration enabled on the Rim Walls too, allowing players to grind the outer wall of the grid to gain speed. This speed boost can also be compounded by grinding 'outside' a cycle wall, up against the grid wall. Grinding Inconsistencies It is only possible to gain speed from the closest wall to your cycle, another parallel wall to the one you are grinding on the other side of the wall to your cycle , will not bestow any extra speed. This does have an interesting effect in servers that have a large factor of outer wall acceleration set, and you should be wary. If a wall that you're grinding that is is close to the rim wall suddenly disappears, you'll experience a huge and unexpected increase in speed from the rim wall. Note: rim wall"

Grinding in Team Games Not only is grinding an essential skill when attempting to best an individual opponent, but it must also be employed in a team game, where a faster team can easily overrun a slower one. In a team game, you should always attempt to grind at the start of a round to give your team the benefit of speed. Further information on this and other tactics can be found on the Teamplay page. The Relationship Between Grinding and Rubber As grinding against a wall often requires very precise timing, Rubber can play a big part in getting closer to a wall. Rubber effectively allows you to drive your cycle 'deeper' into the wall (See digging ), and gain a better grind. Depending on server settings, this effect is often used over and over by players to create a slingshot for themselves by repeatedly turning 180 degrees against a wall and grinding deeper and deeper against it. In earlier versions of the game, this could sometimes lead to a player 'breaking out' of the playing arena into the limbo beyond, however this bug has been fixed since version 0.2.7.0 of the client ."

The client retrieves the user's password (from the user or from storage in memory or the hard disk) p. The client calculates H(H(p)+s) and sends the result, together with the username, back to the server. The real password, or anything useful to steal the user's identity, is not transmitted. If H() is a good trapdoor hash function, you can't reconstruct H(p) or even p even if you know s. Simple Case: Game Server = Authentication Server When a user is to be authenticated, the server generates a random salt s and sends that with the username to the client. It waits for the response with the client's version of H(H(p)+s). The server fetches the real H(p) from the database, calculates H(H(p)+s) on its own and compares. On match, the user is authenticated. Game Server and Authentication Server are Separate On the Authentication Server The authentication server waits for connections from the game server.

Another thing to note: the game server now does not have the possibility to use the authentication server's response to imposter the user on another server. The information is just good enough to verify the user's identity. On the Game Server When a user is to be authenticated, the server sends the username to the authentication server and waits for the response, consisting of h1, s1 and s2. It sends the username and s2 to the client as in the simple scheme, the client returns h2' = H(H(p')+s2) where p' is the password entered on the client. The server calculates h1' = H(h2'+s1) = H(H(H(p')+s2)+s1) and compares it with h1. If they match, p must be p' and the user is authenticated.

Mwahaha! Countermeasure: The salt s2, as the client receives it from the game server, always gets the game server's IP and port appended to it before it is used for scrambling. The authentication server does the same. Then, the phishing server would need to be able to forge IP traffic and appear at the other game server's IP. Alternative: Three way communication. The salt s2 is not actually used by the game server, it could be sent directly from the authentication server to the client.

It is therefore possible to prevent specific players from playing by bringing down their auth server.

Simply put, the game client is the program you run on your computer. The game server runs on somebody else's computer. The difference between the two is like the difference between, say, a lawyer and his client. The lawyer would be the server, the one who knows all about law and stuff. So the difference is just like in real life where the terms come from. The client requests a service from someone who serves. In our case, that service is a game that is served from a machine running a program called a \"server\", but if you requested the same service from a person in a casino, you'd still be running a game client.

No, most, if not all, game servers available through the master server run a special version of the program that has no graphical display, and no player can play on directly. That is the server, commonly called a \"dedicated server\". You can run one too, if you like.

If your server is connected to the internet via a router box and not directly via a \"modem\" of sorts, it is likely that network packages from the internet can't get to your server because the router blocks them. You need to tell your router to forward UDP port 4534 (or whatever SERVER_PORT is set to) to the server. On http://www.portforward.com , there are nice instructions how to do that for a lot of router models. If the UDP port 4534 thing confuses you, just follow these instructions for a different game that uses a similar connection method. Of course, you need to find out what router model you have, some under-the-table-crawling and cable following may be required for that if you can't remember what you bought"

Will there be support for the neat new cockpit in 0.2.8.x? No. The cockpit stuff is developed in the lp:armagetronad brach (called trunk) and is a major new feature there. Only bugfixes and very much needed features are added to 0.2.8.x versions. What about <feature X not in any of the 0.2.8 alphas/betas>? Will it be in 0.2.8? Same answer as above. There's a quite obvious and annoying problem in version 0.3.x, why isn't it fixed? That problem probably comes from some experimental code someone committed a bit too eagerly. It is not currently possible to easily fix the problem the right way, or we would have already done so. Before we can fix it properly, we either need to do some work elsewhere first (which you can bet we're doing) or the person responsible needs to find the time.

One of the reasons this game can carry a popular international competition is because of its unique combination of simplicity of design and complexity of play. You can play this game with two keys -- two keys! -- albeit with a certain crimping of style. It allows people to think ahead, create mazes to trap opponents, and failing that, players can rely on their reaction times.

Because of the game's simplicity, and the range of skills available to the player, and the depth of play suggested in these early days, Armagetron Fortress has the potential for being a global virtual game standard. And while computer games improve in terms of virtual-realness, this game becomes better merely as the technical net limit of PING reduces. This game is the virtual equivalent of CHESS or GO, combining strategy, competition, and adding teamplay.

In this way, they stand out from other clans who strive for wins and bragging rights, though there is no lack of skilled players wearing the Rx tag. Over the years, Insomnia Clan has been through many ups and downs, including two near-deaths and one complete disintegration. Despite all of that, Rx is back and working toward re-claiming the glory days and ushering in a new golden age of Loose DF. As of July 20, 2019, they have set up a temporary forum at RxTron until their original website can be relaunched, and they are currently in the process of tracking down wayward members to bring back into the fold.

It was then he decided that instead of trying to find a place to fit in, he would create his own. With the help of Who?, the first iteration of Rx was born, and remained small and obscure until the addition of tech whiz dukevin, who helped to usher Rx into the forefront of the grids. With an ever-growing roster of rockstar personalities, pro players, and genius level skillsets including well-known tron coder Kira/Light, Rx became one of the most visible and prominent clans on the grid, creating innovative new server concepts such as Rx.Freaks, FPS, and Ship Battles.

Jump forward about one year to around 2015. Rx had been operating with a skeleton crew headed by dukevin, light, and pdbq, trying to stay alive in a dying game, when Vibe returned to the grid and attempted to jump back in and rebuild. Vibe's strong-handed tactics and militaristic vision didn't sit well with some of the remaining members, which eventually led to a nuclear fallout between him and one of the senior members, Pdbq, causing Vibe to rage quit the clan. This time when he left, he stopped paying the bills as well, which lead to the clan's domain and forums defaulting and expiring, sending the membership into the wind.

The client decrypts this data and confirms the server's identity. The client sends the session identifier back to prove that it holds the key advertised. The server now knows that the client indeed represents the player it claims to. Stats and Conversation The game server deals primarily with a public key or, in the case of an anonymous player, a guest name, which is enclosed in double-quotes. All conversation and stats are recorded by this identifier. For example, when sending a chat message to another player, the server will transmit something along the lines of: PlayerKey[68b329da9893e34099c7d8ad5cb9c940] says, \"Hi!\" Displaying Names For Players (Name Resolution) Obviously, no human wants to see \"PlayerKey[68b329da9893e34099c7d8ad5cb9c940]\". To deal with this matter, when a player is authenticated, they receive a name resolution URI from their authentication server.

If the key is known, the name associated with it will be displayed. If it is not, the client then asks the game server to resolve the key's name for them. The game server will send back the name requested by the key. The client will now inform its name resolution server of this key<->name association, and the server will verify that the name does not conflict with another key. If there is a conflict, the server will modify the name (possibly by appending a number) and inform the client of the changed name. Alternative: Nicknames for Authorities The goal is to provide display names of the form <user name>@<authority name>.

For z-man, the players will be named luke, luke(2), meriton and meriton(2) in the nickname resolver scheme. For lucifer, using a different name resolver, they'll be named the same, but in different order: luke, luke(2), meriton(2) and meriton, and when z-man and lucifer are talking about them, they have to remember two possible name replacements. In the alternative scheme, if the two authorities have different names, say fe and bot, the four users will be named luke@fe, luke@bot, meriton@fe and meriton@bot for everyone. And that's a likely scenario, as authority name collisions are easier to avoid from the start than nickname collisions. If the two authorities have the same desired name fe, the players will be named luke@fe, meriton@fe, luke@fe(2) and meriton@fe(2).

The authority name resolution can be done on the client locally without need of an extra server (further implementation simplification) The rest of the protocol needs minor adjustments, but only insofar as different data needs to be sent. Instead of player keys, which are useless here, the authority has just one master public/private key pair. The temporary/partial keys delivered to the players also contain the restriction to the player's username: they don't say \"This key is equivalent to the master key\", but \"This key is equivalent to the (not really existent) sub-key of user <name> of the master key of authority <desired authority name>\".

The clients now know the tuple (<user name>, <authority key>, <desired authority name>) of all other players and can indirectly verify that the player identified by that is indeed playing by sending a challenge to the other client indirectly over the server. Isn't it typically the case that the player trusts the server he is playing on? If so, it would be ok if the game server verified the keys.

If you're going to start as an alternate, keep it on so you can chat with us if need be. Remember, though, that a lot of us play fullscreen and won't see what you're saying. If you don't have these problems, then you should stay in the channel until the game is over. Maybe we'll have some post-game discussion afterwards, and if you quit your client to play the game, you should rejoin the channel. Since we're going to hang so much important communication on the irc channel, you should make sure you familiarize"

Generally, Lucifer thinks there aren't any secrets worth keeping anyway, the other teams will see it all soon enough. We might work out specific moves in practice, give them names or whatever so we can make appropriate calls, whatever. Other than that, there's not much we can't put here, and it's important everybody know what's going on. Bottom line: no strategy works if your team doesn't know the strategy. If we're going to err, err on the side of too much information rather than not enough.

These are good teams, that won't be a reliable tunnel, and we'll do better if you survive longer than 10 seconds each round. Depending on what side the goalie is on, the grinding player on that side will need to break a little early to make sure the area is covered. That side will be the weak side! It will be weak because the goalie will more than likely have to wrap around to seal the back. Since that will put him on the same side as his guard, there will be no defense. So don't break too early, but break early enough that you can reliably stop any opponents from getting down that side. Need I say? None of that double-grinding crap will work for us. After Break Naturally we'll generally want to break as late as we can, but we can't count on quickly outflanking and rushing down their side. These are good teams and we'll likely get ourselves killed if we try to win that race. So we'll generally want to break, run"

This will hopefully funnel one or two opponents into that space in the center. Our offense should try to take out 2 opponents and then advance as a group. So, no mad single-player dashes against the fortress wall. We need to advance as a group and try to isolate their players, taking them 2 v 1 as much as we can. Now, this is the ideal situation, it's not likely to happen as often as we'd like. But since we should be advancing as a group, that means we can also pull back as a group should the other team get the upper hand. Keep in mind that falling back as a group pulls their attackers toward us and away from their defense and is a good way to keep the odds even during the fight, so it is preferred over attacking. Offense shouldn't fall back all the way to the defense. If we're getting pushed that hard, better to let the guy through and sandwich him between the offense and the"

Generally speaking, the other guy is more likely to kill himself trying to get around your block than you are to kill him in an attack. More likely if you attack him, you'll wind up chasing his tail back to our fortress. Should you have to misfortune to chase his tail back to our fortress, just block his escape route and rejoin the offense, they're waiting for you. Of course, don't leave our defense outnumbered or outgunned, if you need to stay, then stay. Defense What kind of defense will we run? Well, turns out that most of our players prefer to play as guards rather than inner/outer defense. Personally I enjoy playing as guard but springing off the goalie's wall, those compartments tend to attract roaches. So we're probably going to prefer a guard/goalie setup. Just make sure if you're the guard you don't stray too far from the goalie. Obviously if we have the luck to play 6 v 6 or higher we'll run a layered defense and put out midfield defenders.

Changing Tactics This is our general guide. We'll practice various configurations and various tactics, of course, and we'll adapt our tactics to the team we face as needed. Some teams we'll perform better against by trying to put 2 players in their backfield as quickly as possible, and we'll want to do that against those teams. Other teams we'll perform better against by holding back and playing defensively, advancing only when we are ready to overwhelm their defense. Other teams might read this guide and figure out ways to channel our own movements based on this guide. This is fine, it's just a general guide.

During the game, you should make sure you tell the team what's going on, like if you suddenly have to go run out to the yard to get your kid, a simple \"afk\" will suffice so we know to deal with it. That stuff you already know. Changing tactics should be more or less automatic for most of us at this point. Watch your enemies alive gauge, that's what tells you when to advance and when not to advance. We make calls to one another already, so watch for them. Don't try too hard to second guess your teammates, sometimes you just have to move on trust. But don't overtrust and leave the guy in an undefensible situation.

In the event that you get conflicting advice from players either living or dead, go with your gut instead. :) Choosing to defend is usually a better choice when you're not sure what to do. Wavering in uncertainty is usually a very bad choice. So favor defensive advice over offensive advice. Who decides when an alternate comes in? Without knowing how it will go, I suspect tht we'll only pull in alternates between matches, and except for the center player, we won't need to change the lineup much, if any, during a match. In that case, I'll probably make the call if nobody else does. I'd rather folks volunteered to be relieved by an alternate, but if nobody volunteers and it needs to be done, I'll say something. If I miss the game for some reason, then y'all should probably designate someone as being in charge under the same kind of loose structure.

We can probably secure a place in the top 4 slots just by being organized. By skill we can get to the championship and win it. But we can't even get to the championship unless we're organized and communicating, so check the wiki often, check irc often, and so forth. Talk to each other, use the discussion pages here to talk, and show up to practice at least once a week. :) That stuff will do more to help us win than this strategy guide.

That ended up 2-0, but then when it came to the second round we only had 6 players, and DS/oops had 8. 2020 and wrtlprnft helped us out, big thanks to them. We got through that, also 2-0. We then had to wait about 6 hours for the final, due to the TuI vs Mr Men match being delayed. When the Mr Men all arrived, they had 7 players, so wrtlprnft left and 2020 continued to help us out. During all this time as the server wasnt locked, random people kept joining and screwing up the teams, meaning the final got delayed even moreso. We went down 1-0 in the first match which was really close, like 100-94."

This led to a lot of irritation and confusion (like random people shouting 'this match it starts!' even though we already waited 30 minutes and we knew durka would show up in another 15). Ofcourse durka didn't officially know who we were but he could've posted something on the forums, it would've saved us alot of misery.

So, I was just going on past experiences. Sorry for the confusion. As for the matches, indeed, FWW got too cocky and we caught them by surprise the 2nd match. As usual, we (or I guess I) weren't prepared seeing as I got 1 round of warmup after rushing home. Then again, everyone was pissed off and wanted to start. Another problem I can see was the player limit. We were expecting FWW to show up with 5 players since they had only signed up with 5, but oh well. So, we ended up filling the server with 16 players. The big problem was, I was locked out and spammed my teammates aim/msn to tell them to get rid of one of our teammates so I could join.

Holes, heh, I've gotten holed everytime I've played the Ladle, so for FWW to hole me constantly over 3 matches wasn't surprising, but one thing really pissed me off. It was 4 on 2 (we had 2) and my defense was pretty big and my sweeper (don't remember who it was) was doing a great job. Then, I see their defense and sweeper attack. They grind eachother the length of the grid and torpedo into my defense. You can say that's good strategy, but, if a team has to torpedo me to win, it pretty much takes the fun out of it. Especially since this was near the beginning of the 3rd match. So instead of us getting a possible 10 points for winning the round, they get 10. Basically a 20 point swing.

Rather than showing experience and their skills,which I was so looking forward to, it ended up as an opposite. The first two matches were great, the opposite team was doing incredible job, before I guess we pissed them off and caught them by surprise by winning the 2nd match. After that the whole hell turned lose. There wasn't no more competition, there was only one way one and one way only, HOLING!

It would be nice if we could just import an entire team into a server. Have some kind of pre-grid preparation like in the film. Once teams are sorted, we just port into the server. Would be simple. Players would then turn up on time, otherwise, they just miss the boat. Trying to organise a match while playing is tough... too many distractions. Still... we managed it in the end... somehow...

Next time 2020, can we please not try and play the tournament ALL IN ONE DAY!!! Too chaotic! Manta Getting Wraith Squadron ready for each match was actually quite easy. All our players met in an MSN chat room one hour before the start time and we did all our coordinating from there. This made it very easy for us to all show up on one server at the same time.

The text area was too small and too many people were talking. Some were asking me to die so that they could join the game -- as if we were meant to be playing! Some of the non-captains were useful since they could leave the T-room and search for players like Xevi for Crazy Tronners, and the state of play in matches. Team-captains did the job well though, challenging one another, then setting off to do their matches. However, I think we should have waited until everyone knew who was playing who and where before leaving. The only real way of doing this is building a simple interface with challenge-board, etc so that people could see if they were challenged and whether they accepted etc. Still.. on the whole, it worked.

Also, losing teams could have played one another. In fact, we probably had time to play a round-robin affair. What was best about it is that we ended up with a winner. We trusted team-captains, and they pulled it off. My wishlist? Somehow keep teams together, maybe with some kind of pre-grid preparation room like the film. If this runs simultaneously to gameplay, you can be playing around in some server, and then when your team is assembled and ready, you are notified and requested to port to the proper server where your team assembles against the opposing team. Also, some kind of software to automate the challenges. The chat-facility was not good enough... too much"

Manta --- Having the ability to lock a server to a certain number of players ahead of time. While letting there be room for a couple of spectators so backup team members can standby but keeping riffraff from joining. --- Letting a small majority successfully kick someone, without having to distract all the players with the vote. --- Have shuffle down AND up enabled to allow team placement. --- Have more servers available. --- Personally I liked the month long idea but I must say having the games all on one day seemed to work better. But this also made it very hectic and with elimination, losing teams only got to play one match after the effort of getting everyone coordinated. --- Over all I'd say the ladle was a great success and everyone had a great time which is most important."

Ideas suggested during the game was to split the final between two servers. Also, the captains did not make use of the challenge room in the wiki. It was all just organised before the matches, which was ok because we only have four teams of about five players each. The idea is for the system to be future-proof, scalable to hundreds if not thousands of team... I can't see this working that well with more than four teams. I think team captains should take a little more responsibillity for making sure they choose a server that suits their players. And of course, it is the responsibility of the players to turn up!

Manta If we are to drop scheduled games again from not enough teams show, we should move those matches up in time instead of delaying. WS lost half their players do to the time being changed. We do need to work out the scheduling on the wiki better next time as the matches ended up being switched right before game time.

It is when 100% of one team's players have 1/3 the ping of the other that attrition will catch up every time. (Not to bring up my 438 ping ;), lol) An average 180s on one side vs 60s on the other can be a bit unbalanced. Similar to a 4 vs 7 player match. To solve this I don't think a single server can be found to please everyone. Germany does have some of the most active players so it would be wrong to say force them to play a US server for example. Perhaps some ideas can be worked out before the next ladle. Playing half the games on one server then switching might cause it's own logistics issues. What are some other peoples ideas?

Their first comments are generally \"this server is $@%&*, I have a 190 ping\" and leave. Heck I play with 350!! of course not as well as I would like. Because of the size of the land mass many Americans average a 190 ping on THEIR OWN servers!!! I'm sadly beginning to get some VERY unfavorable impressions of certain players.

The chief issue I had with organization was there were many channels for organization. Specifically, there is the wiki, the team captain server, the IRC channel and in-game chat. The channels disagreed on many matters, sometimes even with itself (For instance, there were more teams on the challenge board than in the brackets page.) Documentation was so bloated and disorganized everyone considered a different subset. Some team captains were also not well prepared (in my case, this was because I was elected replacement captain 10 minutes before the first match). Also, some channels are inadequate for coordinating stuff. For instance, in-game chat on a full server where everyone is talking, and where the other team captain is busy playing most of the time.

Here all Team-Captains register their teams , the names of the players present, and their state of play. Last minute alterations to brackets should be decided upon, and once confirmed, all players can view the brackets on the wiki at the Challenge Board. Because of the nature of knock-outs, there are often many bye's: these should only occur in the first round, and they can be filled by teams formed at the last moment, eg by pool-players in the IRC chatroom. Team-Captains return to their teams and confirm who they are playing and where. If there are any problems, regarding players or servers or technical faults, Team-Captains are advised to return to the Team-Captain chatroom to look for assistance.

Tronic Monkeys, a group of non-affiliated players along the lines of Anarchic Wanderers, managed to scrape a win both at the Semi and the Final. Tronner under the Influence played brilliantly, took the first match, lost a little concentration in the second, and turned in on themselve in the third deciding match. I thought they had better players and when they attacked, it was fearsome. For some reason I ended up the solitary sweeper quite often, not a good position for a team to be in, and we lost half the match because of it. But they got worried in the third and started to play defencively; I think this was their mistake. Against Wraith Squadron, it was a super tight game. There seems to be a pattern, once a team exerts itself, winning a match, the normally relax a little and lose the next match. WS won the first, lost the second, won the third, lost the fourth, and I suspect the only reason they lost the fifth is because one of their members disappeared. Superb skills."

There was a lot of argument before the game with TuI because they wanted to start early, but I am glad I stuck to the time schedule because our last teammate turned up 10mins before the official start. There was also a lot of argument about 4v4 since they only had four players whereas I was happy to accept players to have as large a game as possible. Eventually we agreed on 5v5, but actually we ended up with 6 I think. I have to say, if a team fields less than 8 that is their problem. They should not bully the opponents into playing with less numbers. However, if a team wishes to reduce their number, then it is their choice, in order to make the game more balanced. I think it worked out ok. I suggest that organised clans make up their numbers. This is an 8v8 game. I think these numbers make the game more exciting. Players for"

It was just me and Zop and Zop basically gave up trying to get in my defense. He kept making a half-circle around my def. It was about a 2 minute \"battle\" between us.

We even had a one man advantage I belive at that point. They took the winzone and that boosted the score to 86-70. We could have easily won that match. Then, to top it off, they holed me (I was def) and went in and got the zone (using their 2 man advantage made it quite impossible to stop them while in the zone). Them winning that match completely turns around the entire finals. Instead of being 2-1 us, its 2-1 them. Then, in the 4th match, it was definately getting close, and it was 96-88 in the final round, and for the 10th time in the finals, I got holed by ~*SP*~ and they took the match. My point I'm trying to make is that: There should be no winzone what so ever I know we've talked about this before, but as long as a team gets at least 5 or 6 players there, the other team should at least cut 1 person.

I'd have ignored them, but when theres so much spam it takes up half your screen and you have to play with only 10 fps anyway, it kinda pissed me off. Not that I was playing well anyway as it happens, but when I'm subject to \"omg, our def sucks, alex you made us lose\" etc etc criticism from my OWN TEAM because I was being distracted multiple ways...

You'd need zones that conquer themselves for that to work, but that would make it impossible for one player to attack the other if it's 1v1. — Wrtlprnft 15:27, 4 March 2007 (CST) yes... perhaps the winzone is necessary for nonfinal rounds... in order for the timing to remain within the realms of feasibility --16:05, 4 March 2007 (CST) MaZuffeR pointed out that we could also get rid of shrink. Although a while ago I wouln't agree with that, it seems a good possibility now -- madmax 17:14, 4 March 2007 (CST) Personally I prefer the long fights.

I think defending is too easy as it is now. There isn't many settings that can be changed to make the game more balanced without affecting other aspects of the game too much, but shrink is definitely one of them. -- MaZuffeR 05:09, 5 March 2007 (CST) I agree that it has become a very defensive game..I remember early on when you could go on streaks of just owning"

However now that I think about it, that would not be good for any defense other than \"THE SQUARE\" lol..because imagine skip's defense if the zone was bigger...he would only be able to get 75% around just cuz he does so many angles in it. Just an idea to throw out there G5 Again, my team (TM) lost in the first round. Have I ever been in a second round? Don't think so. But for the first time it was fun to play. We lost because the others (SP) were better -- a little better. But we didn't loose because we paniced or fu**ed it up. That I like. Madmax showed great fights as defender in match 2 and 3.

And let's be honest, it really was a one man show. Who else would have done it? Andrei, unable to hole successfully, is currently banished to defense after Orion completes his requisite round, allowing him to pad his stats on the dead stats page , and call wolf 'el segundo.' Who else? Ampz? He doesn't really give defenders any trouble, and we don't really see any cuts from him.

We definately need to stop using servers with Max_clients 16 because theres no room for subs, admins or the like. As normal there were laggy servers everywhere. I'd propose rather then using a random method to pick servers have the servers on the challange board before teams sign up and first come first serve to which servers people want. If two teams dont have opponants we use common sense and pair them together based on what the majority wants.- Corn 17:58, 8 December 2008 (PST) The closest final I've ever seen. 3-2"

Looks like things went pretty smoothly on the whole, but I think we need to be tighter with the start times. Can’t believe we have to wait for a month, or three weeks, till the next one. I hit the grid monday, practicing a technique to speed ramp alone for 30 mins, then one, then two, then the whole place was filled with players for hours. Ashitaka suggested incam, and for two hours I just had a whale of time. I also recorded some games. I want to have that much fun in the next ladle. 2020 I think it went really smooth for the organisational part of the tournament, also I want to thank all the admins for being there on time, no problems at all in this Ladle. As for the matches, I think that organisation can make a difference nowadays. Thanks to Flex, we were organised this time as well and so we were able to win it without losing a match, grats team I think I played decent, I don’t play as a wingmen that much usually, but"

The Ladle is the monthly version of the Tronic, and is currently only played in the Fortress gamemode. Depending on the amount of teams signed up, the ladle is a single-elimination tournament with teams starting in the quarter or semifinals. All games will be played out over a few hours, so plenty of excitement as well as a climax -- perhaps your name will be listed on the next Tronic Ladle !

For complete and up-to-date information about what to do, review the operations like at the top or the bottom of the page. Objective The primary objective the The Ladle is to increase the size of the competition, hoping to host an event with over 100 players. In order to reach that number of players, we need something like a marketing strategy. Is it through word of mouth... through advertising.. can players encourage others to join by posting invitations in other game forums? At the root of it all, however, is the game itself. It is essential that the first experience a player has of the game is a pleasurable one, and hence some thought must be paid to how new players are treated. Inviting new players onto teams, informing them of the Ladle, may provide the right support for them to have fun and develop as players, and thereby increase the level of competition globally. We need new players! Some players have taken it upon themselves to start up new teams, recruiting noobs, training them up, and hopefully presenting"

The Bowl is played on the last Sunday in April every year, a few weeks after the season ends. A season is nine months long and runs from August to April. This leaves three months of off-season play for teams and players to reorganize (Fortress participation generally falls during the summer months of the Northern Hemisphere). Statistics are recorded for each Ladle of the season and are later used to determine who is eligible to play The Bowl and how those teams will be seeded. The top 4 teams will meet in the Bowl, seeded by rank. The current ranking formula is: ( Round wins + Ladle wins ) * ( Match win / Match total ) Requirements to play in The Magargle Bowl are as follows (Rule of 5): Teams must play at least 5 of the 9 Ladles in each season.

If you substitute for another team during the season make sure to move your name to their roster on the Challenge Board before the next Ladle. Late edits will not be accepted.

About the finals, I didn't really care that it was 6 on 8 and they had a 2 man advantage, but what really pissed me off, was that it was 1-1 and in the 3rd match while the score was 76-70 their lead, the winzone popped up. We even had a one man advantage I belive at that point. They took the winzone and that boosted the score to 86-70. We could have easily won that match. Then, to top it off, they holed me (I was def) and went in and got the zone (using their 2 man advantage made it quite impossible to stop them while in the zone).

I'm fine with a one-man advantage & I'm also fine with a two-man advantage, or even 3, but if they use those extra men to hole the defense 10 times throughout 4 matches, then that (in my mind) is a bit unfair. Rico I dont mind doing it in a reg game, but in a serious tourney, when I'm trying to def against 4 attackers, I dont take kindly to the rest of the opposing team spamming me with messages to put me off.

It wouldn’t take much more time, because they play at the same time as the final would be. At the moment there are enough fort server online to realise this idea.

And legit what the hell is your problem are you even in TUI? You already have a terrible rep in tron after those comments you made. k3nNy well, as some partially blame their ping (see the finals) for loosing, i went through zmans stats and compared the finals with the x-sp semifinals. well here some stats first: match 1 Tui vs Sp: Tui: 6 players, average 176 ping Sp: 8 players,"

Previously, community members might make a forum poll or some complaint thread and people would argue a point. Very little was ever accomplished and every change was a challenge to authority of sorts. At one point, people began to question the nature of the Ladle rules themselves and the authority for which they had been created. [1] It was clear something needed to be done. By February 2009, just about everything related to the Ladle was in question again. A discussion of rules broke out, but this time it was about not just what rules we should have, but how to decide on them as a community. [2] Lackadaisical pointed out"

The first quarterly vote coincided with Ladle-21 and was used consistently with great success. [4] The process was simple and went smoothly for a long time. Every third Ladle, a discussion thread was created to talk about Ladle issues. Ideas were argued thoroughly. One week before the Ladle sign-ups close, a voting thread was created. The thread contained the choices for teams to vote on. Only teams signed up could vote, one vote per team (if you had a large clan with 2 teams, that meant 2 votes). Voting closed when sign-ups closed. Note: occasionally situations arose where emergency voting was needed and the previous Ladle teams were used. This system shaped Ladle Fortress into what it is today. However, quarterly voting was suspended in January of 2011 due to irreconcilable differences (some felt there was too much tampering with the tournament and others felt voting was a chore).

If there is no backup server (for instance, in the opening round) a public Fortress server may be used if both teams agree. If a team tries to bully their opponent by refusing to play in the designated Ladle server they are in forfeit . In the extremely rare case of a missing primary and secondary server, teams should be accommodating to each other and the rest of Ladle by quickly moving their match to a public Fortress server and making the"

In this case a Ladle Discussion Thread is created to break down the problems into choices that can easily fit on a ballot. After the discussion is exhausted, a Ladle enthusiast makes a Ladle Voting Thread with a ballot linked to the discussion. Here is an ideal thread to use as a model. Only teams signed up on the current Challenge Board can vote, one vote per team (usually by a Team Leader or designated representative).

I guess you could say it's part of the game, plus you can always silence trashtalkers. That's what a big part of our team did. And I don't really see a big difference between what Mr. x said and what some people from |x| said to Omega when he showed up after the finals.

The big problem was, I was locked out and spammed my teammates aim/msn to tell them to get rid of one of our teammates so I could join. Then, we started playing and we had 8 players, but we did not know that Luzifer and Sky were locked out of the server. Then garisimo's connection dropped after the 3rd round or so. By that time, I'm guessing, Luzi and Sky had probably stopped trying to connect to the server. So, we ended up playing 7 on 8 vs FWW.

(For instance; Z-Man's server should only be used for the opening round .) Explicit feedback about performance is collected after each Ladle to fill the chart below, usually in the form of a (+/-1) in a post. It is a good idea to double-check and see if the poster actually played in the server. Posters cannot vote a server up or down more than one point. Scores reset on location change (check IP). Six months of data is sufficient to rate a server and stops the table from getting bloated with dead addresses. All servers start with a score of zero.

However, the underlying hardware is not capable of truly instantaneous response, and therefore, neither is armagetron. This difference is called Lag. When you decide to hit a key, the following stages are passed: the command is transmitted to executing muscles the muslces contract / the key is being pressed armagetron is busy doing other stuff armagetron processes the key press and dispatches the information to the game server (network games only) the network forwards the information to the game server"

If this delay is constant, its effect can be mitigated by hitting the key earlier. If the delay is different every time though, this is not possible. The delay introduced by the individual stages can be approximated as follows: Stages 1 and 2 takes a predictable fraction of a second, less with training. Stage 3 predictably takes at most 1000 ms / fps . Stage 4 predictably takes a couple of microseconds unless the client's computer is very busy otherwise (such a case has never been reported) The sum of the delay in stages 5 and 7 is called network lag. It is determined by the quality of the network connection between client and server, in case of the internet the chief influences are the client's and the server's connection to the internet, as well as the geographical distance between client and server. The sum of the average network delay is called ping and displayed on the score board."

Since usually this is the primary source of lag, we describe it in more detail below. Stage 6 is negligible unless the machine running the server is otherwise occupied at the time the message arrives. Stage 8 predictably takes at most 1000 ms / fps . Network Lag Armagetron provides two facilities to assist players in coping with constant network lag: Prediction and the lag-o-meter. Prediction displays other cycles at where the are predicted to currently be on the server assuming they did not turn in the meantime. As a result, cycles jump on the client's display on a turn (because the client guessed wrong). If prediction is disabled, cycles are displayed on the last position confirmed by the server, i.e. they are really no longer there, but the client does not know yet where they are. The lag-o-meter highlights the area where the cycle could presently be. Prediction and the lag-o-meter can be enabled/disabled in game->network game->network setup. Due to its non-predictable"

It may also cause lag-o-meter to suddely grow or shrink. Avoiding - 6 pigs, 7 nipples! Buy a better internet connection and/or keep your other network usage down. When you see someone's ping fluctuating in the game, it's usually a safe bet that they have a really large download going on somewhere, KaZaA or some other large downloading program. Web browsing while playing the game will create more lag for you, which will in turn get pushed out to other players. You have a limited amount of bandwidth available on your internet connection, and the game server has a limited amount of bandwidth available on its connection. Some server admins will limit the number of players on their server to address this issue, but it's still not complete. You have to behave yourself and keep your bandwidth"

For example, the Crack Pipe runs on a server that is also a web server, mail server, cvs server, and a few other things. On top of that, it's used as an alarm clock, and as a regular desktop computer. So it's using a fair amount of bandwidth just running, which gets pushed out to game clients. But also under the heading of limited resources vs amount of demand, the Crack Pipe only has a 900mhz AMD Duron processor and 256MB RAM. That's not really a lot of system resources for the amount of work it does. So occasionally spam will be sent to the machine and it will have to spend some of its precious CPU time receiving the spam. In the meantime, game clients suffer a little bit. Some players have gotten to where they can identify how much spam the mail server receives while playing the game.

So electrical signals don't travel instantaneously, they merely travel so fast that the conscious brain perceives it as instantaneous. So, to start with, every time you press a button on your computer, the electrical pulse associated with that button press has to travel some distance from the button itself to a location in the computer, and then be sent out over the wire to the game server. Hops, not beer The signal's first hop is the game itself. Of course, that doesn't mean anything unless you know what a hop is. A hop is considered a point along the path where the signal has to be processed and understood, at least in part, to determine where it's going to go next. So the first hop is your computer.

If you're on a high speed network, you have one. It may be called a \"dsl modem\", \"dsl router\", \"cable modem\", or whatever, but it's still a router. It processes the signal to some extent, enough to figure out where to send it. Then it sends it. If you're running a local network attached to a cable ISP (a very common setup among players), then your first router sends it to the second router. So now you've had 3 hops and the signal hasn't even left the house yet! Then your ISP's router will pick it up, process it again, and determine where to send the signal.

I'd bet money that the lag you're experiencing and blaming the game for comes from somewhere else. An associated comment usually comes along the lines of \"but there has to be something in the game that can be done to compensate for it.\" This statement frequently accompanies a list of other games where lag isn't as big of a problem. Z-man's take I'd like to add that the prime reason you feel more lag in AA than in, say, Counter Strike, is the difference in the game dynamics. In shooters, moving (thus defending by taking cover) and attacking (pointing your mouse and shooting) are independent actions. Taking a hit does not influence your movement immediately (it does later if you get wounded, or immediately if your pushed away by an explosion). Thus, it its possible to treat attack and defense separately in the network code and hide the lag. When you shoot at someone, you can shoot at the position you see him now, and even though your enemy really has moved away already, you'll still hit him"

It's not possible to divide the different aspects of movement in the network code. (Well, it is, but the result would be that it would be impossible to survive close combat for both participants) In this sense, AA is a sports game, a beat em up to be precise. And you don't see them played over the net a lot precisely because they're heavily affected by network latencies (and because it's that much more fun if you're playing against someone in the same room). Z-man's take (part 2) There are several causes of lag. You need to understand what happens when you press the turn key. First, at the time you press it, your client doesn't have the full information of the state your cycle is in. It only has an extrapolation that is based on what the server last sent. The first causes of lag lie directly here, the extrapolation may be wrong. If any/all of (1) - (5) goes wrong, you'll be lag sliding/jumping on your own screen with possible crashes. (1) Maybe the"

(note)Obviously, if your client is sending the turn with a wrong gamestate, then the server will have a different view and won't be able to execute your command exactly as you expect. The server has the capacity to detect these errors, but it can't distinguish between (1) and (2). And it can't fix the problem by believing the command data from the client, this would give way to cheating. So let's assume your client has a reasonable game state in memory. Your turn command is then sent over the network to the server. (4) Of course, it can get lost or delayed on the way.

And if you experience lag and death at virtually the same time, chances are that you were not actually killed by lag, but that the lag you perceived was actually the effect of the server trying to keep you alive. Also, the client ignores all game world events that usually would kill you and does not predict your death, because false positives there would be very disturbing. That's why you sometimes happen to see your cycle pass behind the receding trail end of another cycle or over a vanishing trail, touching it a bit, going straight for half a second, then warping back and exploding.

Lag is reduced by parallel processing on the server, so if you have a fancy Xenon processor or a dual proc setup you can have less lag. Lag is reduced by running a 2.6 Linux kernel over *any* other kernel (Windows, Linux 2.4, I dont' know that any others have been tested in this way). It can probably be reduced even further by applying the low-latency patches, but since those are mostly used for audio work I don't know how well they'd work here.

Either way, you'll get a shiny new directory called armagetronad-<version>. That's the source. No bootstrap is required here. From git If you're a developer and intend to do some hacking, don't just grab the source, fork it directly and make it your own!

So enter X automake autoconf where X is \"sudo apt-get install\" for Ubuntu, \"apt-get install\" for Debian, \"emerge\" for Gentoo and \"yum install\" for Fedora. You need root rights for all but Ubuntu. The SVN/BZR processes should have left you with a source checkout in the directory named \"armagetronad\". Do cd armagetronad ./bootstrap.sh cd .. to generate some files that are not kept in the source repository because they can be automatically generated in that way. Typically, you don't have to repeat this step after you update the source via \"svn update\" or \"bzr pull\" or any other way, the build system will take care of that.

Also, the password you need to give to the Autopackage installation, should you forget the sudo, is YOUR password. Installing the Dependencies Before you think about installing Armagetron Advanced, you have to prepare your system for it. Don't worry, not much is missing from most distributions. The complete list of requirements of current stable versions is libstdc++5, libSDL, libSDL_Image, libpng, libxml2 (version 2.6.12 or above) and of course OpenGL and GLU. Depending on what you want to install, you can scratch some of that: If you install from source, you don't need libstdc++5, the libstdc++ that comes with GCC will be used, but you will need development versions of all dependencies and the build tools GCC and GNU Make. If you install a server, you only need libstdc++5 and libxml2. If you install from a .package, libxml2 is included and you don't need it"

The build prerequisites can be installed over Homebrew or MacPorts . Our automated builds use Homebrew because its libraries integrate better with the macOS system and are easier to pack into the app bundle. Therefore, if you don't already have one of those on your system, pick Homebrew, you're less likely to run into problems. All code blocks are to be entered into the terminal.

You'd also need dylibbundler and create-dmg for building dmgs; you'd have to work out yourself how to get it working. Get source and build Follow the Linux Instructions for these parts. One small deviation: If you want to build a proper App Bundle later, do not use the configure script in the main directory, use src/macosx/configure_for_bundle.sh (for 0.2.X) resp. desktop/os-x/configure_for_bundle.sh (trunk/0.4). That one one calls the main configure script, feeding it the correct directory structure.

If you want to sign the bundle and notarize and staple the dmg, the app bundle content has to be in just the right form; having configured the game over the configure_for_bundle.sh script should do the trick. build_bundle.sh expects your secrets in exported shell variables or the fixed shell script ~/.ssh/armabuild_secrets. The top of the script explains what is needed. The old way See Mac OS X . For the longest time, nobody on the dev team had a real Mac any more, so the XCode UI based build has fallen into disrepair.

It is optional, but it reduces the maintance of keeping your installed software up-to-date. Getting the Source The armagetronad source code is available from two sources: subversion and bazaar. Bazaar offers more features for developers wanting to work on and improve the game. Subversion If you are running Mac OS X 10.5, you already have subversion. If you are running an older version of Mac OS X, install svn with macports, using the command sudo port install subversion .

This has always been the behavior of the game. So what is the effect of having non normalized Axis? Before anything else, a bit of understanding how the engine of Armagetron operates might be required. You might recall from your physics class that the distance traveled is computed from the speed at which you travel multiplied by the time during with you traveled ie: distance = speed * time. Armagetron has at its core a 2D engine. Vehicles move along a 2D surface, changing their x and y positions. To find the new position of a vehicle, the distance is multiplied by a 2D vector, the direction, before being added to the old position. Because the direction is a normalized vector, the resulting displacement is of the same size than the calculated distance. But if the direction is a non-normalized vector, ie: it has a size that is lesser or greater than 1, but not equal, then the displacement gets to have a different size than the distance.

Example: Axes of size 2 <Axes number=\"4\" normalize=\"false\"> <Axis xdir=\"0\" ydir=\"2\"/> <Axis xdir=\"2\" ydir=\"0\"/> <Axis xdir=\"0\" ydir=\"-2\"/> <Axis xdir=\"-2\" ydir=\"0\"/> </Axes> Example: Axes of size 0.5 <Axes number=\"4\" normalize=\"false\"> <Axis xdir=\"0\" ydir=\"0.5\"/> <Axis xdir=\"0.5\" ydir=\"0\"/> <Axis xdir=\"0\" ydir=\"-0.5\"/> <Axis xdir=\"-0.5\" ydir=\"0\"/> </Axes> By setting the normalize attribute to false, the designer ensures that the game will use the Axis values as is.

Normally, with the Axis all of the same size, it would take a player ten time as long to run from one wall to another when cruising along the height of the rectangle. But you could decide to make motion along the height occur at ten time the rate, so it would take a player the same time to cover the height of the arena than to cover the length, giving it an \"Alice in Wonderland\" feeling (see example 6.2.1). This feeling could be exaggerated even more by making traveling along the longest distance occur in half the time that travel along the shortest distance. To do this, you could double the size of the Axis set in the previous example (see example 6.2.2). Now, even though one dimension of the rectangle is 10 times that of the other, traveling along this longer dimension occurs at a much higher rate, compressing this dimension in the player's mind.

By increasing this too much, your map might quickly become unplayable. While the example present Axis size of 10's and 20's, it is only for a pedagogical value. If you want to create great difference of displacement among different Axis, you might find that augmenting Axes size a little bit and raising others also could produce a better effect. The following example offers a ratio of 6 between the displacement on the x's and y's, while keeping the faster displacement at only 3 times the regular one. This reduce the effect of playing at very high speed while having a huge difference between directions. Example: Factor of 6 between displacement, centered around a speed of ~1. <Axes number=\"4\" normalize=\"false\"> <Axis xdir=\"0.5\" ydir=\"0\"/> <Axis xdir=\"0\" ydir=\"-3\"/> <Axis xdir=\"-0.5\" ydir=\"0\"/> <Axis xdir=\"0\""

To specify this, two methods are offered: Vector orientation: In this method, you specify the direction as a vector, from (0, 0) to (xdir, ydir). This will indicate the direction to be face by the cycle. Angle orientation: In this method, you specify the direction as an angle in degrees. Because Armagetron is a game where motion occurs"

Doing so improve maintainability. Something that is obvious during the creation of a particular map often becomes very cryptic after a few weeks. A good comment allow you to quickly grasp the meaning of what is described. A comment in xml starts with \"<!--\" (without the quotes) and ends with \"-->\". Comments can span multiple lines. If your editor doesn't highlight the commented part, be careful not to exclude a part of your map by mistake. Arena size The original map is of size 500 by 500.

Also, arenas with many divisions or made of many interconnecting rooms might find the efficace play space shrunk. Giving them a bit more surface might help balance this. For example, if rooms are organised in a 3 by 4 pattern, with corridors connecting them, many of the space between the rooms is lost. The map designer might try to have a total surface of for all the rooms that is of 250,000 square game units (the same surface than a 500 by 500 room). He might feel that ignoring the surface of the corridors compensate for the large amount of walls reducing the motion. On the other hand, one could easily imagine a extremely large maze. In this instance, the true factor would be the corridor width rather than the total size of the play area. There are no hard rules of any sort about the size of an arena.

Then debug your script and run it again, redirecting the output to the same file, while keeping arma still running. On the next round it will use the new version, saving you a lot of trouble you'd have if you were testing on a dedicated server. Bonus Tip: If your map won't load in the client, be sure to check if the output of the script doesn't contain any warnings or errors from PHP or whatever language you use. The output may only contain a valid map file or the client will refuse to load it. Once you are done with all the debugging copy the script to the server.

Why Maze? Upper Left: An inefficient radiator pattern (Womble). Upper Right: Conserving space with repeated triple turns (Kulting). Lower Left/Right: Creating a basic spiral maze Mazing is the natural result of efficient space management. When playing any Snake/Tron-like game you will eventually be put in a position where you have little room to maneuver. The better you are at maximizing space for yourself, the more likely you are to survive and win. Let's look at a classic example. Let's say you are trapped in square or rectangular space.

Whatever you decide, be sure you can clearly see not only your own trail in good detail, but also the environment around you. Control over triple turns is essential. Make sure you can get extremely close to your trail when needed. Be able to make triples of various sizes as these are key components of most mazes. You should also have enough control over single and double turns to create consistent step patterns. Learn to trace your trail without using rubber. Sometimes you want to trace tightly, and sometimes you want to trace loosely and consistently, creating tunnels to enter and exit. Also, learn to trace other trails without using rubber.

Tunnels with lots of close turns may be confusing but they offer a consistent speed. Experience will help you find the right balance. Also, most players use the brake key -- not just for slowing down in an emergency, but to create tighter turns inside mazes. If it feels clumsy to turn while holding the brake key consider using \"toggle brake\" instead. The argument for toggle brake is, you don't need brakes very often and they recharge rather quickly so you might as well exhaust the entire brake reservoir at once. Finally, it's very important to develop a sense of how long your trail is. To have complete control over space you must be able to follow the end of your trail. Staying just on the inside edge allows you to protect yourself from attacks and positions you to expand on space when available. Building Blocks Top Row:' Paperclip with an inside triple.

Consider how they fit together and try rotating components 90 or 180 degrees so they fit together like puzzle pieces. Also, mirrored or symmetrical building blocks can help make some truly interesting mazes (see the Maze Gallery for examples). The key feature of complex, efficient, and infinite mazes is layering .

While some of the techniques in this guide can apply to traditional death-match games, it's the zone-based games like Fortress and Sumo bring mazing into focus. You can be a great player without being good at mazing, but all the topmost players have excellent mazing skills. That's not to say great mazing ability will make you a great player, but it's one skill you should spend some time developing (don't ignore mazing, just like you don't want to skip leg day at the gym). Players sometimes spend an excessive amount of time practicing beautiful, elaborate, complex mazes. These are rarely used in competitive environments, primarily because mazes are situational . Zone-based games are extremely dynamic, leaving little coherent space to work with. Chains of smaller, functional mazes that use low amounts of rubber and provide quick escapes are the dominant form."

    "text": "However, being prepared to make an ad hoc , complex layered maze can help you win a round, so definitely practice those too. Mazing buys you time. Making small mazes with just a few turns can keep you hovering in position while you wait for an opportunity to attack or escape. Even tripling back and forth along a line (kulting) can be enough to keep you alive in a fast moving environment. Mazes can feel passive or aggressive. Some allow you to hide safely inside your own trail for a while, others leave you often exposed to danger (or leave you in a position to attack or escape). Finally, it should be stressed that knowing where the end of your trail is will often be more important than how good your mazes are. Mazing helps you manage space, but in competition control of space is key. If you get cut badly no maze will save you. Sometimes you have to seal yourself in until you have an opportunity to expand or move, though in general you should consider making the space you occupy unnavigable to intruders.

The game makes many assumptions about the three models here, and if your model doesn't violate those assumptions you should be fine. It is a relatively simple text based mesh description format: lines starting with \"v\" define a vertex, the first number that follows is the vertex index, the next three numbers are the vertex's coordinates. Lines beginning with \"f\" define faces; the three numbers that follow are the indices of the vertices that form the triangle. There are converters available to convert to this format.

There's no space for texture coordinates or surface normals. Armagetron Advanced just maps the textures in a predefined way by projecting them from the sides. .ASE Models .ASE models are a text version of the 3dsMax model format. Normally 3dsMax stores its models in a binary format that is somewhat proprietary. You might be able to find a converter for it, you might not. 3dsMax will export to a text format, and .ase is that format. It is a fairly common format and there are numerous converters. The catch to using this format are summarized in this list: Cycle wheels will not be animated. For that matter, your model won't have any animated bits. It can only be used in the moviepack You can prepare your model for animation by setting the pivots right and making a object group for each part to be animated.

For some time beanerTRON, the leader of the infant clan, went around promoting the clan. A player known as worm.bot decided to join the clan and make a forum. After this worm.bot changed his name to Ghostly, and became co-leader. With the new forum and leaders, the clan started to get some members, but they were mostly noobs. Yet with some training and experience these players became good and made the clan reputable. During this time the clan began to expand outside of CTFS, until they played in almost all divisions.

Then, once the leader, beanerTRON, decided to leave, the clan slowly became less and less active and was on the brink of dissipating. Many records were set in it's name. When NbK was down to its last few loyal members, Ghostly felt it was Vital that immediate action be taken to ensure the survival of the clan, so he made a deal with Nand, Former leader of Sk, a rival shooting clan and the current leader of Hackers Association, which was also having inactivity problems.

The title track and gui track will still be played from bundled music! There is no plan to change this until we have support for some sort of music pack. Even then these tracks will be played from internal locations, and if the user wants his own custom tracks, he'll need to build a music pack to play them, when we have those ready to build.

I'd like to have the idiom \"1*4\" supported, where sequence \"1\" will be repeated 4 times. eMusicTrack should support this format, and there is already a placeholder method to handle it. It needs to be hidden from the callers, so the caller and indeed the playlist object shouldn't care what format the files are, and eMusicTrack will just do the right thing for any file. Sound Effects Sound effects are partially implemented. Here's what works: Pushbutton effects There are two kinds of pushbutton effects. There's a simple pushbutton, which just plays the effect at its volume, with no effects processing. There's a 3d pushbutton effect which takes an eCoord and plays the effect in 3d.

When an eGameObject spawns, if it has a continuous effect, it should direct eSoundMixer to start playing it. In the PlayContinuous argument list is the eGameObject that generates the sound. Using an effect callback, the mixer should compute the 3d effect for that sound based on the eGameObject that owns the sound and the eGameObject that has camera focus. So, when a gCycle spawns, it needs to give the cycle motor sound. This part works. But when the cycle dies, it needs to end the sound, and this part doesn't work. I don't know how the grind is handled now, but it needs to be a single sound file looped, and whenever a grind is detected, PlayContinuous should be used to play it. This will allow a cycle to get grinding noises from both sides when it's in a tunnel! Standard Effects Processing We need to have several effect processors that we use on all effects.

We need something that will be able to compute loosely in realtime based on the cycle's changing position, so if an explosion happens immediately in front and to the right of a fast moving cycle, that explosion effect needs to be doppler shifted, and it also needs to feel like the cycle is driving past it. I intend to do this first by copying and pasting the SDL_Mixer effect into our own callback and then tweaking it to work with our own data structures. Speed variation is a complex topic that I won't get into, except to say that we need to support varying the motor speed in the same way armagetron has traditionally done it.

But sound effects in the middle that are heard by the walls should have a bit of an echo. There are some good, low-cpu-draining ladspa reverbs we can use here if need be, but we may not do it at all. If we do it, it's intended only for sound effects that will have a 3d effect applied. Known Issues The problem I'm having with PlayContinuous is that one or the other or both of the eGameObjects involved, either the sound owner or the mixer owner, are being deleted, and the mixer is not finding out about it in time, so it segfaults trying to compute the 3d effect on one or more eGameObjects that don't exist.

This is the only part of the sound engine that has yet to be laid out, so if you work on it, you'll be on new ground. I'd like to support sound skins with this new setup, but that's as far as I've gotten in working it out.

At the very least, this process takes time, and initial communication of Armagetron with the master servers and servers fails at first.

It had a pretty wild 3-pointed map with lots of hallways for good close fighting, with interesting terrain features that seriously impacted tactics. It was taken down in part due to its low popularity, but mostly because Lucifer wants to reclaim server resources on his server for more important things and there's plenty of fun servers around.

Objective The primary objective the The Ladle is to increase the size of the competition, hoping to host an event with over 100 players. In order to reach that number of players, we need something like a marketing strategy. Is it through word of mouth... through advertising.. can players encourage others to join by posting invitations in other game forums? At the root of it all, however, is the game itself. It is essential that the first experience a player has of the game is a pleasurable one, and hence some thought must be paid to how new players are treated. Inviting new players onto teams, informing them of the Ladle, may provide the right support for them to have fun and develop as players, and thereby increase the level of competition globally. We need new players! Some players have taken it upon themselves to start up new teams, recruiting noobs, training them up, and hopefully presenting a team that might win the much-sought-after Tronic Ladle!

Originally intended to house the former Swift clan mates, this plan was soon shelved when it failed to materialise immediately. Upon recruiting [][4m|cO][], a different direction was formed. Instead, <P)hoenix became a different project. In 2012 October the clan had some big, drastic changes. The clan was streamlined, and has begun to live out some of the success it aimed for. In 2013 the clan continues to grow and compete successfully in fortress tournaments, such as Ladle 72 and 74 where Phoenix got to Semi Finals. Phoenix is opened at the moment, if you wish are about to apply, do so here . We have enough active players so contact us for a war/challange. The clan dies on 14th January 2014. <P)hoenix Roster <P)hoenix Roster can be found here. The <P)hoenix Group"

First we had one team to forfeit, they even signed up on the day of the event and only H2H invasion was around to play. Come on now, nearly EVERYONE else showed except that team. You guys really started off the problems for me, I had to squander to get a team for ToGa to play. Then we found out that iZm server can only hold 8 positions, therefore we need at least ONE new server to play on. Then ToGa had to move to ID server since SP newbies had a bye and everything was almost starting to get going. H'h vs Legitimate skills was going VERY well..I think only 3 people total did not show up between the two teams. Then another problem arised, QUARG (who hosts both the ID server and the H'h server, with two matches being played on them, started to download pr0n lol.

Again server problems, H'h vs SP Newbies was going fine until the server suddently crashed, that game never got going again probably because of frustration due to all the problems. SP Elders beat ToGa 2:0 and would have then moved to finals but then I decided just to let the tournament go since it is just the Tilt Pilot (The first tilt isn't until September 9th, 2007) SO NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

Put succinctly, Armagetron is \"A Tron clone in 3D\". An more detailed explanation can be found on the About page. What is a client? What is a server? What's the difference? Simply put, the game client is the program you run on your computer. The game server runs on somebody else's computer. The difference between the two is like the difference between, say, a lawyer and his client. The lawyer would be the server, the one who knows all about law and stuff. So the difference is just like in real life where the terms come from. The client requests a service from someone who serves. In our case, that service is a game that is served from a machine running a program called a \"server\", but if you requested the same service from a person in a casino, you'd still be running a game client.

No. This is where people get really confused, even to the point where they complain to server operators for doing exactly this thing. No, most, if not all, game servers available through the master server run a special version of the program that has no graphical display, and no player can play on directly. That is the server, commonly called a \"dedicated server\". You can run one too, if you like. Server operators chose to run this instead of the regular game client because it has a number of modifications that make it work better as a regular server, just like a mail server or a web server.

Press too hard on the cushion and you hit the wall. Turn while you are pressing on it, and you will yourself tightly placed against the wall, leaving little place for someone to follow.

Everyone who thinks closing his bad can go to a No-Rubber server. One of the main arguments that is used to underline the importance of playing open is that \"all the pros do it\", which is not true (according to a poll i started on Armagetron forums several months ago). Playing \"open\" doesn't require a broader set of skills than playing \"closed\", ie. \"closed\" players NEED to know how to grind as tight as possible, open players don't. The skillset required for playing \"closed\" translates to \"open\", not the other way around. (\"good open\" players may be more skillful at mazing than \"skilled closed\" players, simply by virtue of the fact that \"skilled closed\" players don't need to make mazes, instead they force others to do so.) i would therefore draw the conclusion that \"closed\" playing requires more skill and is therefore the superior gametype. maybe that's fallacious, whatever. until open is an official gametype, \"open\" players can eat wall.

But if they kill you, you can't even win when you're trying to close them. low risk-high reward (in their heads). \"Open\" does in fact hurt the game beyond just the players' attitudes and behaviours (although that's bad enough). For one, no, it absolutely does not speed up the game. Completely the opposite - their so-called \"traps\"—these unnecessary, lame little 180s and squiggles made with your double/triplebinds cause more boredom than excitement. And to talk about low rubber and closing not giving players a chance to make a mistake—hello, dipshit, that's the point! Get better! Don't make critical mistakes!

Patience, sobriety, diversity and proper organization led to a strong, competitive and respected fortress team. By now, PRU has hosted a couple of tourneys, they have their own Armathority (@pru), innovative servers , and a fresh looking site. And just in case that didn't impress you, the clan's members are skilled and friendly as well! Many things changed over the years; we improved both teamwork and our language skills. Today, PRU is admired for its brilliant sweepers Hamar and Sixzero, whose precise reactions can't be matched by any other player besides Xyron. The past taught us that we aren't unbeatable, but it's never been difficult for us to have fun while we were together. Unlike other clans, we haven't been involved in any kind of drama .

Currently there's nothing in tXmlResource, it's a placeholder. What it *should* contain, however, is the ability to read tags that are standard across all resources, such as the parent <Resource> tag. It should also understand tags that reference other resources and internal binary data. So the code path to loading files into memory passes through tXmlResource. For an initial implementation, we can just put the actual code into tXmlResource, later we can work out a fancy way to register mimetype handlers to allow components to hook in their own special formats. tResourceManager, then, will scan all resource directories creating its own internal list of tXmlResources, and it will use that list to do its work.

When it's time for a component to request a resource, it will ask tResourceManager for an instance of that resource and tResourceManager will provide it, either by creating a new one, by dynamic_casting the one from its list, or whatever else we dream up. So the rest of the game, then, will only access resources through tResourceManager. No component will create new instances of a resource, all will always get points from tResourceManager. tResourceManager will always retain ownership of the resource instances, so components will not delete them, ever, though they will inform the tResourceManager when they no longer need it so it can perform cleanup.

A file loader is something that loads a resource component that is not a resource itself. Actually, that's a little too vague. When a subclass of tResource is registered as a resource type, its file extension will be used and tResourceManager will know that it's also a loader for that type. More on this later. Other than resources, resource components are generally assumed to be binary files that require special loaders that are fundamentally incompatible with each other. And it does so through a common interface. :) A loader returns a child of class tResourceComponent. The loader's owning module should declare and define that class. The loader itself creates the class instance with tNEW and then returns it. We should probably provide a convenience macro that makes it a dynamic_cast to tResourceComponent. In any case, the loader returns a pointer to tResourceComponent, one way or another. It should take as its only argument a complete path to the file.

We also get comprehensive resource management within tResourceManager via tResource, and this is true for even new resource types, and we get this without sacrificing extensibility.

It is true that the subclasses of tResourceComponent will be instantiated by the loaders registered with tResourceManager, but the loaders themselves exist in the module that needs them. An example of how this works is best: rVisual is a class that is capable of rendering models. So it puts textures on them and performs transformations that allow animating the models. To load a texture, it provides a method that is capable of loading PNG files. During global variable initialization, it registers this loader with tResourceManager. rVisual's PNG loader is marked (texture, png). tResourceManager now knows that any component that wants a texture that is a png can do so using rVisual's PNG loader.

In this example this is important because there's a wall between rVisual and the rest of the game, where rVisual is not allowed to give any data to the rest of the game because it's a rendering object. So when an rVisual is instantiated, it is told by the rest of the renderer that it needs to load a model resource, and it's given a tResourceDescriptor.

That is, it's there to deal with the fact that when you hit a wall, and the server thinks you've hit the wall, it's a physical impossibility for you to be certain you're near the wall. So rubber makes it possible. In short, without rubber, there would be no internet game. Once upon a time, it was an internal mechanism that existed for server administrators to configure, allowing them to build different types of servers that were playable that might otherwise not have been so.

What Rubber Is As mentioned in the introduction, rubber is a way to deal with network latency. It's very simple in concept, when you think about it. Let's say you connect to a server and your ping is 200 milliseconds. Now, some other guy and you are racing towards each other. Just before you would pass each other, the other guy turns and blocks your path. It will take you 200 milliseconds to get aware of this and send your reaction back to the server, assuming you yourself can react instantly. Of course, you don't have 200 milliseconds, you'll collide and be dead in 100 milliseconds. Enter: rubber. When you get close to a wall, rubber artificially slows your cycle at a certain distance from the wall. This change in speed is artificial, it doesn't affect your actual speed in any way. But the time it takes for you to crash against that wall is stretched. By making this stretch, it is possible for you to see that you are in fact touching"

It is not a new type of gameplay. It is none of these things. How Rubber Works Rubber works two ways, depending on how the server is configured. You either have time-based rubber or distance-based rubber. Time-based rubber works by measuring how long (in milliseconds) it will take for you to hit the wall and applying rubber to it. Distance-based rubber works by measuring the actual distance between you and the wall. Both have the same intent, but work slightly differently. Distance-based rubber is good for servers that have very little changes in speed. Some examples are the Tigers Classic servers, the Goshdarn clones, and a few others. Low cycle acceleration is what distance-based rubber is good for. And it's really good for that! This is the traditional"

Time-based rubber is good for servers that have a lot of cycle acceleration, resulting in large differences in speed between cycles. In this case, the application of rubber will vary for each wall approach, but it will behave consistently and predictably for players. After rubber kicks in, it begins to deplete. When it is depleted, you are touching the wall and the server destroys your cycle. When you leave the wall, you begin to recharge your available rubber until it is full. This unique system makes it possible to carefully plan a wall approach, run your rubber up to its maximum, and turn, making a very tight grind against that wall. Then, if you wish to turn towards the wall again too quickly afterwards, you will die, because you don't have enough rubber. In a tight maze, this means you might make the first couple of turns, but your chances of surviving drop with each grind because your rubber cannot recharge fast enough.

The rule of thumb is that you should only adjust any of these settings in order to compensate for other changes that cause the rubber system to break down. For example, if you change cycle acceleration to some really high amount, you will have a server where high speed players will tend to crash because they lack rubber. You probably want high speed players to be able to grind as easily as low speed players, so you might want to increase CYCLE_RUBBER to compensate. The flip side is that lower speed players will be able to grind deeper against the wall. There's always a trade-off, so consider carefully what you are after. It is generally considered a bad idea to increase rubber too terribly high. If you set it high enough, you can make death impossible on your server, and that's probably not a good thing.

(Not recommended right now because the old clients will ignore it.) The speed at which you approach a wall is determined by CYCLE_RUBBER_SPEED . Mathematically, if you are at distance d from a wall, rubber makes sure you don't approach it faster than CYCLE_RUBBER_SPEED * d. Since this speed of approaching may be slower or faster than with the old code depending on the framerate, people complain about it. Therefore the new client reverts back to almost the old code ( a tiny minimal distance to walls is still kept ) when any pre-0.2.7.1 server or client is involved. The server admin can disable this admittedly dangerous behavior with CYCLE_RUBBER_LEGACY 0 . Client Synchronization Settings Old servers would send all cycle syncs once per second. Since 0.2.7.1, the interval is configurable separately for the client that owns a cycle and all other clients in the CYCLE_SYNC_INTERVAL_ settings.

At the low speeds before the grind, the positional command interpretion is inaccurate and will usually turn the cycle too early. Now, old clients don't send the command time, so this code can't work. The lag sliding is a clear disadvantage, but the earlier turn is an advantage in some situations because it makes you cover more ground, so both the new and the old players have plenty of reason to complain if they are not treated equally. Therefore, when CYCLE_FAIR_ANTILAG is set to 1 and old clients are present, this code is deactivated. When a cycle turns in free space, the server will try to follow the client's request by matching the turn position as closely as possible. Sometimes however there are large desyncs and clients sent silly turns halfway across the grid from their current position.

Alternatives are expressed, clearly, standing side by side. If a person wishes to improve upon an idea, they can modify the text or, if their idea departs too much, they can start another alternative. In this way, it is possible to have several mutually contradictory alternatives presented fully. In this way experience is fed into different ideas. There is no argument. A decision is only made once alternatives are fully voiced. Instead of people arguing their point from the beginning, their ideas are fully explored to their satisfaction, and then once completely explored, the faculty to decide, to judge is brought in. In this way, prejudgement, or prejudice, is avoided, and experience is sublimated into new formulations. Has this happened with"

Instead, this was replaced with one way of doing it, and any suggestion otherwise was considered heretic or even deluded from the start. Which is a shame. My ideas were criticised from the start, with no proper airing, no discussion or exploration. If we are to evolve new ways in this world, and perhaps make it a better place for our children and our children’s children, then I think it wise that we explore these alternative ways of organising ourselves. And what better place to practice this than in our playtime, with things we love, such as playing Armagetron...? And in case you think I take this too seriously, then please consider that my alternative is merely to make an opportunity where we can all have more fun. I think the way it is being conducted is too heavy, to labour-intensive, too tricky to organise, troublesome, and unscalable, which prevents development into greater and greater competitions. That is, the means of organising proves that larger-scale competitions are unfeasible. That is, if we do not play around with alternatives, we shall"

One day, computer programmers will realise the power they hold in modern society, and when this manifests socially, they will need tried and tested ways of exercising this power. And in the same ways that computer games has evolved some important developments in AI, so networked games have the potential to evolve some important developments socially...

Take two players. If they agree, we have a simple solution. Say the players think they are about the same, or one is better than the other. However, if they disagree, this can not be represented linearly; for example both players think they are better than the other. Now take three players, and a more complex phenomenon is possible. Player 1 thinks he is better than player 2 who might agree; but player 2 thinks he is better than player 3 who might agree, while player 1 thinks he is worse than player 3 who might agree. Hence, is should be 1>2; but 2>3 and 3>1... interesting. I wonder if there are ways of representing this in 2d or 3d or even 4d if we think of time and changing evaluations... relative to players of course. I suspect there would be general clumping, and there may be a ladder kind of formation. I suspect there will be boundaries between good and medium players where there is a lot of this kind"

Metrics The bad pun in the heading just says that the Metric System is used internally. Speed is measured in Meters per Second (m/s), distance is measured in Meters (m), and so forth. There are those who say that these are bad units to use. Those folks are invited to write their own simulation without using meters, and then come back and make recommendations. :) Size Factor The standard grid is 500x500m. So the perimeter is 2000 meters, and the area is 250,000 square meters. By adjusting SIZE_FACTOR, you can change how big the grid is. This will change only the size of the arena! It will not affect the length of cycle walls, or their speeds, or anything like that. 30m/s is 30m/s no matter how big the grid is. So if you play on a smaller arena, the same speeds will feel faster than they are just because there is less room in which to maneuver. The actual scaling factor used is sqrt(2)^SIZE_FACTOR or 2^((1/2)SIZE_FACTOR). TODO: the rest"

    "text": "Lucifer sez Ok, assumptions. The base assumption is that there will be an event system. The reason I make this assumption is because we already have a callback system (don't know how much it does, though), and an event system is just a layer of centralized control on top of a callback system, so we can theoretically get there quickly. To build a scripted GUI, we need event classes and widget classes that can be called from C++ (obviously). We need all the regular graphical primitives implemented in C++, and will probably accumulate more complicated graphics routines in C++ that are available to widgets to draw. I could build a python-based setup where you \"inject\" input just like what the CEGUI looks to do. As a matter of fact, the eventManager class I wrote for Acme supports that idiom directly. The widgets I wrote for Acme also could be revised to use graphical primitives exposed by arma, so I could port it to arma as a start, but it'd be ideal if the base widget classes were all implemented in C++ and the event manager itself as well. The advantages are that we'd have a good plugin gui system (I've"

The disadvantage is that the gui requires python, and I know of at least one person around here who wants to be able to build the game without python. If we do it that way, then we need a certain portion of the base gui library written in C++ anyway. In the event system, we need a regular range of input events and custom events posted by widgets. We also need events posted by the game itself, and the game needs some way to distinguish widgets. I'd like to make it so that the HUD is comprised of regular widgets that receive events to control the data displayed and possibly send events based on user input. We could rewrite all the necessary parts of input to use events internally for all input and eliminate polling to some extent. (We could either poll directly and create our events, or do what I did in Acme, which is pull SDL's event queue and create my own events from those) The tradeoff is latency, of course. An event"

    "text": "in a queue that says \"turn left\" just means that at some point recently the player said \"turn left\", and there is a small amount of time from when the input is received to when the event is processed. I should point out that GLTron uses an event system internally. Smile (maybe we can lift some of his code for it, but I suspect it would be better to just use my eventManager class as a model) That would simplify everything and we'd just make the grid display another widget. Keeping the grid display out of the widget hierarchy would have a set of complications, but would provide some beneft in return, mostly performance. Now, it would be reasonable to implement the gui in python and then someone (who wants to build without python) could implement the core parts of the widget set in C++. IMO, of course. So what it looks like is this: In your input polling routine you take each input found and create an event that describes the input and post it to the event queue. In your main program loop, you do two things. One, you tell the eventManager to process the queue. Then you"

The event manager stores all the callbacks in one place. To make an \"event handler\", you tell the event manager what source of events you're watching for, what type of event you want, and the function/method that will be called. So when an event is generated from that source and of the type you want, your callback will be called with the event as its argument. Anything more complicated than that should only be implemented when needed. Wink (my eventManager class is only like 50 lines or so, if that) It's not hard, we've already got a lot of it in place. We've also already got the menu primitives and font primitives needed, we just need lines, boxes, circles, and maybe a few miscellaneous drawing primitives. Here's the last bit. If we don't write the drawing primitives in arma for the scripted widget set, then we have to introduce another dependency, in this case it would be pyOpenGL.

It's common to think of any given \"server\" as a special machine built by old women in third-world countries, but actually, a \"server\" is just any machine that makes a \"service\" available to other users. In this case, you're going to install software on a computer, possibly your desktop computer, that will make a game service available for other users to use. So first you need to acquire the package called \"armagetronad-dedicated\". If you're using Linux, get one that says \"linux\" on it. For Windows, get the one that has \".exe\" on the end of it. For Mac OS X, there's one with a \".dmg\" extension for you. Usually the CPU architecture and OS are embedded in the filename, so pick the right one and install it. We won't go into too many details here about installation, consult the regular documentation for how to install the server for your architecture. Test the Server After installing the server, the first thing you should do is test it. So start"

When your IP address changes, a small updater program will send the new address to DynDNS and update the address associated with the name.

It's not foolproof, but it's the only thing possible until we have player authentification.

Even numbered Shovels have Finals played in a EU server. Servers must flow smoothly and not have too many unnecessary switches.

Both teams must be in full agreement before switching servers. If no agreement can be reached then play must continue in the primary server.

One way to take them out is to create a dead end by reversing direction and hoping the bot follows your initial path.

A discussion on the forums seemed to indicate there were enough people who couldn't play Ladle on Sundays to warrant some sort of Saturday Fortress competition. And since there is usually a large amount of activity on the grid the day before Ladle (as players get some last minute practice in), we can probably organize this into some sort of mini-tournament. This is not exactly the Spoon as imagined by 2020 for Tronic , but some ideas can be revisited. The original Spoon had many problems with organization and communication. However, today's community is significantly more experienced and mature in the sense we have more, stronger tools available than we did years ago and the average player is quite familiar with them. Here is a basic outline of The Spoon: Players join #armagetron.tourneys at 18:30 GMT. Captains are chosen and then draft players. Teams decide amongst themselves who will play each other and what server to use. One representative should place the teams into the bracket on the Challenge Board, then play the round.

If the other brackets get abandoned, the current winners can continue on with any other team that wants to jump into a round (you can have a final against a team that hasn't played a previous round!) There doesn't seem to be a need to carry over the current rules for Ladle, since this is Spoon . Teams aren't even required to sign up, but there is nothing to stop teams from organizing themselves in the weeks previous, placing themselves on the bracket many days ahead of time. Of course, if a team doesn't show up they shouldn't get mad when someone else takes their spot. Remember: This should be fun and informal!"

So every match will be a different game, challenging different skills and emphasizing different abilities. As a team server, you will play in partners. 4 teams each of 2 players will compete against one another in a variety of games, in a style reminiscent of the Olympics. Settings When you make a map, you're going to have to set some settings to make the map play properly. Some of these settings should be made in the map file itself, the same way the settings for the standard Fortress map are made. Other settings, however, shouldn't be made in the map file. CYCLE_WALLS_LENGTH is a good example of such a setting. A server admin can change the size of the map, but the size of the cycle walls don't change with it. So you should create a separate file that contains the settings needed to make your map work. There's no strong guide to this, and if you're in doubt, put the settings in a separate text file.

However, you may wish to make a larger arena that still encourages the same high levels of competition and skill. That's fine, but you should give it a test. The guide is that standard square map, which has dimensions of 500x500 and is set at ARENA_SIZE -3. That gives a 2500 square meter playing area, scaled according to the setting given. If you have a lot of obstacles, you should check to be sure there's 2500 square meters of available playing space, but that's not set in stone. You may find that it's not enough room for the obstacles you have, or that it's too much room. The only guide is to play the map. When you submit your map, Lucifer will test it and try to find the right ARENA_SIZE setting for the server. Games to Play Consider what game will be played on your map.

I'm not saying you should steer clear of these maps, quite the contrary, I'd like to see more of them. As it stands right now, without writing a program, there's no way to introduce random chance onto a map, so there's no random variation available. Scripts will certainly be considered as map submissions, however, if you'd like to write a script to generate maps of a given variety. In any case, you might consider setting up your obstacle courses and mazes as deathmatch, fortress, or sumo style games instead of racing maps. Those types of games force players to introduce the variety that is needed to make the map stand on its own. Similarly, when constructing a racing map of any kind, consider how you can use the game settings to address the variation problem. If you make it possible to slow down other players with a the cycle wall, you introduce tactical options that wouldn't otherwise be available. You might give a penalty for core-dumping other players.

So there should be no maximum point award that ends the match. Similarly, there should be no maximum number of rounds. Only the match timer matters, which is normally set at 7 minutes. It is conceivable that you will dream up a map that can only rightly be played once, and the match should end when the map is finished. In that case, you should go ahead and recommend the settings that will accomplish that. The main problem with such a map is that players, especially players new to your map, might need a round or two to figure out what they're supposed to do. With the game changing every match, players might need some time to adapt to the new game.

Rubber is a special case, however, because it's conceivable that you'll need it to behave differently. Cycle trails aren't considered part of cycle physics. You are free to set that to whatever setting you need for your map to work. Some maps make the most sense with infinite trails, some make the most sense without trails at all. Still others will call for a range of trails. Consider carefully, and then make the setting you need for your map. Team Settings You should not modify the team settings. Quite simply, your map should be playable for 2 players up to 8 players separated into 4 teams. This is, unfortunately, non-negotiable.

If you silence everyone, of course, you might end up being kicked. And sometimes it is necessary to vote off another player. Your first choice should not be to kick but to be to suspend. The default is to suspend them for 5 rounds. As an admin/moderator it can be advantageous to suspend yourself and the player so that you can talk it out and they don't feel singled out.

Try singling out one of the other teams players and fighting one on one instead of taking every one on at the same time. You can also try making the other team kill each other by either stalling ,managing to lock 2 or more in a single small area, or making them come after you and creating an escape through which you can get them to send multiple enimies after you often making two or more of them take out each other."

History of Team uNknown In 2009, Pr3 and Custang came to the conclusion their favorite server DurkaDurkaLand (high rubber) was dead. After a talk with Durka about the skill level of fortress/sumo players, Pr3 decided it was time to enter the fortress world. With the his friend custang, they both entered the Fortress Academy. With the teachers Concord/Pikes help, both Pr3 and custang learned how to play fortress. After a few weeks Pr3 and Custang decided joining the existing teams would not be as fun as creating a new team. With the remaining DurkaDurkaLand players (Thump/Teen/Paladin) we started a new team. Team uNknown. The name Team uNknown steamed from the discussion between Pr3 and Custang about how we were at the time \"uNknown\" in the fortress community, and that uNk had a certain ring to it. With our hopes high we played our first ladle, which was considered the \"Bowl\" (Ladle 22) at that time. Though that first ladle ended up in a defeat, we were officially hooked. During the time between the first ladle and our 3rd ladle we included 5 new players into"

Digging Digging is getting as close as possible to a wall without dying. This is done before grinding. This has also historically been referred to as a \"pure grind.\" More jargon can be found in the Glossary . Introduction to Movement Armagetron Advanced works on the unique concept that cycles make 90 degree turns, cannot stop, and will accelerate when driving close to cycle trails. The closer you are to a trail, the faster your cycle will accelerate. Brakes will slow you down temporarily, so use them wisely. Turning also slows your cycle down a small amount. Some servers disable brakes, so a series of rapid turns will slow your cycle down to the base speed. Basic Tactical Discussion The fundamental goal is to cause other players to crash.

You can imagine how entertaining it can be to get older, more experienced players with it. A common \"speed kill\" Probably the most direct way you can attack somebody is to put a box around them. It's simple: drive close to cycle trails to gain speed then draw a square around the player a leaving him in a small box from which he can't escape. This is generally called a speed kill . Many strategies are just variations on the box attack described above. Through a combination of trickery and smart moves you can convince many players to enter an area closed on 3 sides, and then quickly close the fourth side.

Sealing is just a matter of grinding closely enough to the wall you're trying to seal that another player can't get out with a closer grind. The speed kill and the box attack are fairly simple and easy to master. Unfortunately, you'll find that many players aren't susceptible to them. The speed kill has the advantage that it is possible on some servers to gain so much speed that no player, no matter how skilled, will be able to counter the attack. But the more skilled a player is, the higher your speed must be to succeed. It's the same with the box tactic. The more skilled a player is, the smaller the box that is required to ensure a point for you. The smaller the box, the closer you have to be to the other cycle, and the closer you are to the other cycle, the higher the likelihood that they will attack you successfully.

Hopefully it will be worked out in time for the games. :) team formation Most Armagetron players have had experience playing in teams, though because of the intensity of the game, a few players with good skills, have been intimidated out of the Fortress. One of the most important goals of the day is to develop teams. This means that players are supported by their friends and teammates, and any abuse that comes at them will be from opponents, which is kind of expected from some people. And the best way to deal with this intimidation is to gel as a team, play well, and respond by winning. So,"

It's important to note that while Trench incorporates key elements used in classic fortress, they are vastly different and the same strategies will likely be much less effective. The name Trench was chosen as a symbol, as trenches are key points (e.g. around a fortress), to evolve new strategies. A new map has been implemented, as well as a unique scoring system that will be explained below. The Map The Trench map, made by vov with editing by Jericho, is composed of 2 fortress zones, spawn bases known as \"Penal Colonies\" on each side of the map, and multiple death zones strategically laid out with a timer. At the start of the round each team spawns inside their Penal Colony facing a gate leading to their own fortress zone. Exactly 13 seconds after the start of the round, a death zone spawns in a key point blocking access to one of the two gates. For the first 3 minutes only, respawns are activated, allowing teammates to be revived by touching your"

Respawned players can leave their PC by driving through the second gate (2nd Gate will close after the 3 minute mark). Respawns are disabled after the 3 minute mark as well. It's also important to note that the rim has a significant acceleration rate, which adds a whole new set of dynamics for attacking and defending a zone. Scoring Based on the scoring system used in Trench, it's clear that strategic holing is being greatly discouraged in this gamemode, as entering a hole created by ones own team causes you to lose 4 points.

First she introduced the notion of a network of organisers, something like the developers of Armagetron, but more to do with faciliating the self-organising that players may do on their own. Second, dang there is no record of it on the chat since we were talking... perhaps something to do with authenticating players and teams... I hope Wolverine can remind me... oops. Her final contribution was quite sad... but it something sadly all too realistic. She couldn't handle the abuse. As we all know, the fortress can be pretty intimidating... blood starts pumping... nearing the 100 mark in a good match... the launch becomes important... and noobs enter and frustrations can run very high... and then of course there is the young-male rough-and-tumble play.

Wolverine went into some detail regarding problems with money and time-syncing with different servers, and we discussed most of that through voice so i have no recording of this suffice to say it was exactly where i am blind: serious here-and-now practicalities. My initial response was to emphasise that I have no interest in money, but that I thought that the developers deserve something for all the fun I got out of the game, and I kind of like seeing skillful player rewarded for amazing skill. My second response is to leave most of those technical details for later once we have enough players who are interested in the idea and we start to learn the social skills to bring it about.

To my mind we apply this critical faculty too early which is another reason why the idealistic objective is presented first: if you like the idea then whatever objections you come up with makes you you want to come with the solutions rather than presenting them to another as if you have already been defeated by it. Anyhoo, these ideas and reasons are covered elsewhere on this wiki... contributor's guidelines .. I think.

A List of every player's GID is maintained by the League operators. You will need to be on that list to be able to play. This is a measure against smurfing and against ringers. This list will be updated weekly as players are added and dropped. The TRON League is rolling, teams may join in at any time and the season starts as soon as two teams sign up. After a number of weeks to be determined, the top quarter of the teams enter a playoff bracket to determine a season winner. Games are short, just one match, (estimated time around 10-20 minutes). Teams will play 1-2 matches a week on Saturdays in various time slots ranging from 18:00 to 20:00 gmt. Hopefully players from every corner of the Armagetron Advanced"

Since [FE] on the verge of extinction Sylla allowed Titan to take all 5 of its members into the new clan. With the clan having no name Titan deemed it to be Untitled. The name would be left to be decided once an actual leader was picked. Titanoboa worked with the clan to recruit members and to teach them how to improve their skills in ctf. After a short while Titan left to return to Rogue. WesD and Windrider were left to lead the clan & Camaro was left to be the forums moderator.

Another reason is because it gives us a lot of pointers to what bad design decisions were made, and sheds light on some of the good decisions that were made. In that regard, keeping it where we can get at it will help us to avoid the same pitfalls that are already there and still keep the good stuff that is definitely there. Finally, members of the community who complain that the project may not appear to be going anywhere from time to time can read this and at least get an idea the amount of work that is required to move forward.

Instead of thinking how I could integrate custom graphics the right way, I went straight ahead and hacked some files I got in. One global flag selects which variant gets loaded... No 3d vector class! There is eCoord, a 2d vector class. Everything that needs to be 3d is calculated manually. The cameras have a xy position ( an eCoord ) and a z position. When you don't have a plan, you don't know what kind of support structure would be useful in the long run. Network protocol versioning support to allow client and server to have different progam version without conflict came in much too late. Nobody of the crowd demanded it.

Somehow, I have to think about that old song by Frankie Goes to Hollywood... Discussion Part Two Well, many of you will have noticed one of the externally visible design flaws or Armagetron: it does not handle data flexibly. I could actually stop here because those of you who have either created or installed and used alternative content could take over the rant: It starts with the obscure .mod format the original lightcycles are delivered in. It is a relatively simple text based mesh description format: lines starting with \"v\" define a vertex, the first number that follows is the vertex index, the next three numbers are the vertex's coordinates. Lines beginning with \"f\" define faces; the three numbers that follow are the indices of the vertices that form the triangle. ( This is the"

    "text": "first time this abomination is actually documented. ) There's no space for texture coordinates or surface normals. AA just maps the textures in a predefined way by projecting them from the sides. The reason for using this format instead of the more common .ase, if things have to be text oriented, was only to obscure that I was using 3ds max for the models. And I lost my .ase to .mod converter, so there's not going to be more of them. Then there are the configuration options. Nothing wrong with them from the user side; and from the developper side, it's easy to add new options to the code. So what am I complaining about here? Simple: every configuration option is linked to a variable that needs to be there when the config files are loaded. That leaves almost only one choice: the variable needs to be global. And every programmer gets taught in kindergarten that global variables are evil. They make it very difficult, for example, to have two Lighcycles run with different settings. There is, however, one thing that is even worse than global variables for settings. It's global constants for things that should be variable. I'm talking"

And even when it is clear that an abstraction would be needed instead of hardcoding decisions, a global variable is used. The decision wether the moviepack or the classic data files are used hangs on a single variable. All the rendering paths that depend on it look the value of that variable up and change their behavior based on it: the floor gets rendered slightly different, the rim walls completely different, and don't get me started on the lightcycles themselves. Since everything is bound to one single variable that can have only two values, it is not possible to combine moviepack walls with classic cycles. Then, there are the language files and fonts. Fonts and their implementation are a topic for another WWWIA, but their interaction with the language files fits here. While the language files offer relatively painless translation ( if you can figure out what I meant with the original English ), they have one crucial flaw: they have to be in an encoding that fits to the font that's currently in use.

Both approaches have the drawback that everyting that goes beyond ASCII is easily lost on the internet ( my Eclipse already destroyed deutsch.txt once. ) The second approach has the additional problem that, when receiving chat messages form a server, you'll have to know their encoding. The first approach has the drawback that you'll never fit all important characters ( at least latin, greek and korean ) into one font texture. So, what can be improved here? The configuration variables can stay the way they are for now; they may be evil global variables, but at least they are convenient. They make certain things impossible, like running two networking subsystems at once, but there's lots of other global variables that prevent that. The obvious thing to tackle next, I think, would be the content selection. The next best thing to the current system would be to store the resource names and settings ( wall height, texture transformation matrices ) in configuration variables."

However, you would not be able to select custom cycles for every player, because the cycle model is still stored in a global variable. So, the first sensible step would be to abstract everything about appearance away from the main game; let there be one factory class that the cycle comes to when it needs to get rendered. Implement three such factory classes at least: one for the classic Armagetron look, one for Moviepacks, and one that's really new and does things right. ( Exercise: add one that uses glTron's rendering code :) ) The two legacy classes should offer minimal configurability, say by letting you select a custom search path for the files. For the real one, devise file formats for cycles, walls, floor, skies and rim walls. They should be simple text files in a chunky format to make them easily extensible. Let users mix&match them if they want. Let users select their own cycle by choosing one of the cycle definition files."

It's just a plain zip archive without installer. The included README explains better how to install it than I'd be able to. A problem so far: Darcs uses Unix line feed only line endings and doesn't translate to CRLF like CVS. We'll see whether this matters. There is also an Explorer integration based on TortoiseCVS available. Surprisingly, it's called TortoiseDarcs . It serves as a full TortoiseCVS replacement, too, but for it to work, you need to tweak its settings a bit: In the Tools tab, choose kdiff3 (included) as diff and merge application and for connecting to Unix servers, choose plain cvs as \"SSH cvs server\".

The basic workings are thus: you write a protocol specification .proto file where message types are defined. Each message consists of data elements that have a type, a name and a numeric ID. In your program, you access the elements of the message via regular functions named after the element name. Over the network, the numeric ID is used to keep elements apart. It is easily possible to add new elements to an existing message without breaking compatibility with older server/clients, they'll just ignore the unknown data.

    "text": "interest to coders only. Code Structure Our .proto specification files reside in src/protobuf. There is a prototype file prototype.proto; you can use it as a template for new files. The .proto files are compiled to .pb.h and .pb.cc files by a batch file/Makefile. Typically, no header file should ever include a .pb.h file (exceptions would be templates that absolutely need to); instead, forward declare the used protobuf classes and include the .pb.h file from your .cpp file. Minimal Example The basic feature of protobuf messages is transmitting protobuf structures from client to server or vice versa. To use that, you need four things: a message definition in a .proto file a message handler responsible for receiving the message a message descriptor gluing stuff together code sending the message over the descriptor First, a message definition in the file TestMessage.proto (see the google docs for details on what is allowed): message TestMessage { optional int32 test_data = 1; } Note that the message name is CamelCase and the_element_name_has_underscores. That's google's convention; it makes sure the generated code uses sensible conventions itself. Then, you need the handler function in your .cpp file: #include \"nProtoBuf.h\" #include \"TestMessage.pb.h\" static void sx_TestMessageHandler( TestMessage const &"

The second parameter contains information about where the message came from; it wraps the message it came in and has member functions such as SenderID() giving the network ID of the sender. The descriptor is just a static templated object: static nProtoBufDescriptor< TestMessage > sx_testMessageDescriptor( 999, sx_TestMessageHandler ); The first parameter of the descriptor constructor is the message ID. No two IDs must ever be the same; if you pick a used one by accident, don't worry, the constructor will tell you so with a nice fatal error. Note the naming of handler and descriptor: s<prefix char of module>_<name of message>Handler/Descriptor, with the first character of the descriptor lowercased to indicate it's no function. Let's try to stick to that :) For the sending code, there are several possibilities. The easiest is to use those methods of the descriptor that prepare a protobuf message for sending and return the protobuf to you to work with directly to fill. The message itself is not sent until the next network flush, which usually"

    "text": "happens once per frame or if you trigger it manually. To just send a message to the server, use TestMessage & content = sx_testMessageDescriptor.Broadcast(); content.set_test_data( 42 ); In client mode, Broadcast() sends the message to the server; in server mode, all connected clients receive it. There's two optional parameters: a boolean, telling whether the message should be protected against loss (true by default), and a nVersionFeature const & (must come first), restricting the message receivers to those supporting the given feature. To send a message to a specific peer, use the Send( int receiver ) function. Sometimes, that direct sending is not quite what you want; sometimes you want to manipulate the message itself before it is sent. In those cases, use the more complicated procedure nProtoBufMessage< TestMessage > * message = sx_testMessageDescriptor.CreateMessage(); TestMessage & content = message.AccessProtoBuf(); message.set_test_data( 42 ); // do whatever you need to do with *message.

To turn off filtering, give your string element a name ending in _raw: Message StringMessage { optional string this_gets_filtered = 1; optional string does_not_get_filtered_raw = 2; } This is required for strings that don't represent strings in the game to be eventually rendered by clients, but rather internal strings like protocol IDs. Legacy Stream Messages Our old network system used simple unstructured stream messages. Compatibility with that is automatically ensured; protobuf messages are converted to stream messages by simply taking all elements appearing in the message definition before certain marker elements. Marker elements are those with an ID on the far side of the range reserved for internal protobuf use (>=20000). In this message: message PlayerRemoved { // the object ID of the player optional uint32 player_id = 1; // legacy message end marker, extensions go after it optional bool legacy_message_end_marker = 20000; optional string reason = 2; } only player_id will get written to and read from old stream messages, the reason will be omitted. Some messages even have two markers; those are messages for object syncs, everything before the first marker is written in the creation section of the stream message,"

Changing Messages Over time, needs change, and network messages need to evolve. There are three main ways to change them. Before we begin, It's important to note that the segments streamed for legacy messages must not be changed in any way. You can't add fields, and you can't change field types in those sections. The only thing you can do is declaring old fields obsolete. Change existing fields While in general a bad idea, some modifications are legal. See the google docs for details.

Adapt the existing code reading the field to the new name, but prepare it for the case that the field isn't set any more (by checking has_<old field name>_obsolete()) and for the case that it is still set; if it is still set, have it processed as before. Then, you should bump the network version and add a nVersionFeature named xx_<old_field_name>_obsoleted for the new feature. On writing a message with the obsoleted field, check whether all receivers of the message support that feature. If they do, omit the field.

You need to start fresh. Then, things can get a bit messy :) Replacing whole messages Well, not as messy as you may think. First, you simply keep the code and structures handling the old message type for reading. In case of network object sync messages, you may have to transplant them into a new class. That's not a problem; as long as you keep the ID of the nNetObjectDescriptor and the message type, you can switch the actual implementation class around as you wish without breaking compatibility.

Unlike the other clans instead of being approved then being a trainee when you apply for the fortress or ctf app you are automatically a trainee unless you are rejected. If you are approved you are officially in the clan. Also if you have applied for the clan app and have automatically been a trainee you can only be a trainee for the fortress/ctf division. You can also be recruited by invited. If you are invited to Za you do not have to apply for the fortress/ctf or be invited there.
